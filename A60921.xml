            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Chryſaura</hi> in his Book of the <hi>Diſagreeable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of Love.</hi> It is true, that thoſe Hiſtories have a Stile very Poetical and Figurative, but ſuch as was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Subject he undertook, and to the Mode of that Time, in which it was not faſhionable to ſpeak of the Delights of Love in ordinary words. We may well affirm, that he did deſerve much praiſe in that manner of Writing, and that, by his applications on every ſide, he plainly made it to appear, that he perfectly underſtood both Hiſtory and Mythology; and moreover, that he was thoroughly inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the deepeſt Secrets of Philoſophy. But, being of a flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spirit, he did vary his Stile according to the Arguments which he undertook, and we have other Pieces of his, where he is inforced to make uſe of fewer words, and of more matter. Amongſt all the Works which he hath compoſed, there is none that equalleth this <hi>Comical History of</hi> Francion, which (being weary of wriring Tragical Hiſtories) he compoſed laſt of all, as he himſelf declareth in the beginning of this Book. We may obſerve, that it doth much differ from his other works, for he knew well enough, that in this Book he ought to write familiarly, with out uſing the leaſt affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſince he abandoned a ſad Subject, to employ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon a pleaſant one, it muſt neceſſarily fall out, that in this Book we muſt obſerve a great deal of difference from the others.

We may truly affirm, that at the laſt he hath found his Talent. So long we doe ſeek, that we do find at length what is proper for us. His <hi>Diverſities of Love</hi> were Printed in the Year One thouſand ſix hundred and fourteen; ſince which time he hath made two or three Books, amongſt which there is one, <hi>Of Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Affections,</hi> where, by little and little, his Stile did begin to change; for, to ſpeak the truth, there were divers perſons who were weary of the antient manner of writing, and did deſire ſome Novelties. At the laſt, he entertained his thoughts with no other Subject, but peculiarly did addict himſelf unto <hi>Francion</hi> only; Nevertheleſs, it is probable, that he was a long time preparing himſelf to the undertaking of this Hiſtory; for in his Book of <hi>Floris</hi> and <hi>Cleontia,</hi> and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, you ſhall find that even there he maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Francion:</hi> When he had wrote the Adventures of this Cavallier, he did give unto them the Title of
<hi>The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Hiſtory,</hi> and this was to the great diſpleaſure of
<hi>Du Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hait</hi> of <hi>Champaign,</hi> and as it were to out-brave him; for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had given the ſame Title to a Legend of Accounts which he had compiled; There was a Contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe two Spirits, who were both of the ſame time, but our Author hath far ſurpaſſed him, as may plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the good entertainment which is given to his work, when that of
<hi>Souhait</hi> hath dwelled in obſcurity, being never printed but once. Nevertheleſs, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People, who, by reaſon of that <hi>Comical Hiſtory</hi> which <hi>Du Souhait</hi> did make, will not be perſwaded, but that he compoſed this alſo; But we ought not to faſten our belief to that opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59287:4"/>This Hiſtorical Hiſtory of <hi>Francion</hi> was Printed the firſt time in the Year One thouſand ſix hundred and twenty two, but it contained then but Seven Books. Some other of the following Books being come into the hands of the Book-ſellers, after the Death of <hi>du Parc,</hi> they cauſed them ſuddenly to be Printed, becauſe that thoſe which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Extant were extraordinarily received; but becauſe there were a few breaches in that Original, it is ſaid there were ſome perſons did love that work ſo well, as to take the pains to repair thoſe breaches, and to inſert therein ſome Accounts of their own Invention, as they thought moſt agreeable to the Nature of the Subject. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they made mention of ſome things that were but lately done, many perſons were abuſed in it, and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the whole Book to be altogether new, and would not believe that
<hi>Du Parc</hi> was any wayes the Author of it. Moreover, as the Language is every day more poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed than other, it may be that the Original Copy of the Author had not all thoſe elegancies which are ſince arrived, and that ſome amendment hath been given to that, and thoſe faſhions of Speech have been reformed, which were no longer in uſe; inſomuch, that as a ſmall thing in ſuch occaſions is of great importance, this hath ſerved to deceive the world, by attributing this Book unto thoſe perſons who have not contributed much unto it. But ſo it is, that ſince that time it hath the happineſs to be by every one deſired, and it hath been oftentimes Printed according to the ſecond Addition, without any change, and the Hiſtory containing but Eleven Books, it is to be believed that the Author had made Twelve, and every one demanded the Twelfth Book, but no Man could produce it. This is that for which I would convince thoſe, who would attribute this Hiſtory unto others; for what did hinder them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

At laſt there is one arrived who was with Sieur <hi>du Parc</hi> at the hour of his Death, he is newly returned from a long Voyage, and hath acquainted a Friend of his, that he had <pb facs="tcp:59287:5"/>about him divers Manuſcripts, which ought to be examined, and ſet in order for the Preſs.</p>
            <p>There hath been found amongſt them, a Copy of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the <hi>Comical Hiſtory of</hi> Francion, which, in ſome places was more large than that which we have, and had an other beginning, and another ending; and, above all, the Twelfth Book, ſo much deſired. We have ſo far prevailed, that we have cauſed it to be Printed as you now ſee it, and we have reformed that which ought to be reformed; as for example, The Epiſtle to the <hi>Grandies,</hi> and the Narrative of the Preface to the Book, which were of the body of the Hiſtory, are inſerted in their due places, when all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was put in the beginning of the Book, for want of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe; Nay, and it is moſt perſpicuous that it muſt be ſo, for there is found another Dedicatory Epiſtle, which doth addreſs it ſelf to
<hi>Francion,</hi> which ought to be in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Hiſtory, as it is now placed. VVe doe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that in the Eleventh Book <hi>Francion</hi> doth affirm, that he hath made a Book, which he calleth <hi>His Youthfull Errors,</hi> which he ſaith hath been publiſhed, and yet we cannot find that ſuch a Book was ever printed; It is only therefore but a Fiction, and
<hi>Du Parc</hi> therein hath taken pleaſure to make <hi>Francion</hi> ſo to ſpeak, to amuſe the Readers. It cannot be found that in any ſuch Book
<hi>Du Parc</hi> did learn any of the Adventures of this Cavallier, for in his Epiſtle he confeſſeth, that <hi>Francion</hi> with his own Mouth did relate them to him. Nevertheleſs, it is worth your obſervation, to diſcover if there be not yet another Fiction, or if this <hi>Francion</hi> were indeed a Gentleman who was a Friend to <hi>Du Parc,</hi> and had imparted ſome of his Memorials to him, he having undertaken to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile a Hiſtory of his Life; but we will let that paſs, as being of no great Importance to our preſent occaſion. It may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that we do acknowledge the excellence of the Book. As for the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

They are all ranked in ſuch order, that we may affirm, we have now the true Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory <pb facs="tcp:59287:5"/>of <hi>Francion,</hi> being corrected according to the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of the Author. As for thoſe paſſages which have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto Strangers, we will not diſpute whether they are better or worſe than the Principal of the Book, for all beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do differ in their particulars; but we ought to conſider, that it is ſo little, in compariſon of that which <hi>du Parc</hi> hath wrote, and if it ſhould be left out, it would not blemiſh the Hiſtory. Thoſe Diſcourſes may continue where they are, to ſatisfie the Curious, who will loſe nothing of that which they have once ſeen. Moreover, it is a received Maxim, that Books of pleaſure are permitted to change, more freely than any other. It is moſt certain howſoever, that if any thing be added to this Hiſtory, it muſt be according to the Level and Deſigns of the firſt Author, whom, of neceſſity the others are obliged to follow, ſo that in whatſoever can be done, the honour of it is due unto him. We ought on the other ſide to conſider, that many perſons are to be found, who aſſure us, that it belongs all to one and the ſame Author, and that thoſe Paſſages which are ſuſpected to be anothers, and not <hi>du Parcs,</hi> were not of ſo late a date, but that <hi>du Parc</hi> might well arrive to the knowledge of them, and might inſert them in the laſt Books of his Hiſtory; and it were unjuſt, for two or three diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, to ſuſpect all the reſt. We ought to continue in that opinion, and not to believe that any other than
<hi>du Parc</hi> was the Author of the entire <hi>Comical Hiſtory of</hi> Francion; for why ſhall we impu e it to another, ſince there is no Man found to challenge it himſelf? He hath left us this delightfull Hiſtory, in ſuch a Condition, that it can procure an eſtimation to its ſelf, without being beholding unto any, and the embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that can be brought unto it, are not able to bereave it of the juſt Honour it deſerveth. It muſt not be, that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving may think to attribute unto themſelves the Glory of the Dead. We have many things yet to allege in the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this Work; but to what purpoſe is it, when, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, you have it preſent before you, and you have no more to do, but by peruſing it, to conſider of your ſelves how much it ought to be eſteemed?</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Ach Age produces Tragique Hiſtories enough, which only ſerve to trouble and diſcompoſe the harmony of Mens Soules; This is all Comique; and full of ſuch facetious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, as may unknit the Brow of the ſevereſt Stoique; Yet you ſhall finde ſome things in it not unprofitable: All the Cheats and Gulleries therein related are to inſtruct you how to avoid the like, and the Misfortunes, befallen ſome ill-Livers, may teach you to abandon Vice. Mature Judgements will receive no ſmall Advantage here; for, among the <hi>Drolleries</hi> they'l meet with divers ſerious things; and ſome Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, which (though ſhort) may in apt and well-diſpoſed Soules make a profound impreſſion. 'Tis grand Diſcretion to be warned by others harmes; And to be taught by one, whoſe Method's eaſie and familiar, and his leſſions rather Sport than Paine, is doubtleſſe more conducing to the Learner's benefit, than the obſcure Dictates of a ſterne and unpleaſant Maſter. The Ancient Authors are obſerved in their Comedies to inſtruct the People by giving them recreation; This Work revives their Practice with ſome addition: For, what they onely ſaw repreſented on the Theatre, is here expoſed in writing to your view; and ſince it was compoſed chiefly to be read, each Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Circumſtance is particularly related; So, inſtead of a meere Comedy, you ſhall ſee a Comique Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lready had the Night worn out neare half her Sables, when an old man (named <hi>Valentine</hi>) came out of a Caſtle in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> with a long Gowne on his Back, a red Cap on his Head, and a great Bundle under his Arme. If, contrary to his cuſtome, he had not then his Spectacles (which alwaies uſed to beſtride his Noſe or Girdle) it was, becauſe in the excerciſe he went about, he deſired as much to ſee no body, as he was loath to be ſeen himſelfe; Had the Moon afforded any light, the ſhadow of his own Body would have been enough to diſtract his Mind: So ſeeking nothing but Solitude, he commanded the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he left within the Caſtle, to draw up their Bridge; wherein he was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately obeyed, as repreſenting there the perſon of the Nobleman to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed. Having diſcharged his arme of the burthen, he began to walk about as gingerly as if he had been condemned to tread upon eggs &amp; not break them: And imagining all the world (to the very frogs &amp; toads) were at their reſt, he crawl'd down gently into the ditch, to execute in private ſome part of his injunctions. There he cauſed to be placed, the night before, a Tub of a ſufficient bigneſſe for <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59287:8"/>a man to bathe in; Which as ſoone as he came neere, he ſtript off all his cloathes except his Doublet, and having truſs'd his Shirt round about him, he dipt himſelf in the water above the Navell, then preſently ſtept out again, and having ſtruck fire with a Tinderbox he carryed with him, he lighted a little Wax-candle, with which he march'd three or foure times about the Tub, then flung it into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and quencht the flame. After that, he caſt in a quantity of a ſtrange ſort of powder he had brought, wrapt cloſe up in a paper, having in his mouth a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of odde barbarous words, which he pronounc'd not cleerly, but mumbled betwixt his teeth, like an old angry Ape, being already almoſt ſtarved with cold, though Summer alrady had begun to ſtrew her flowers.</p>
            <p>This ceremony being ended, he began to bathe himſelf, and was very carefull that no part of his body ſhould remain unwaſht: This done, he dryed and cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed himſelf again, mean time his words and geſtures diſcovered nothing but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of contentment and joy. Then creeping up to the top of the bank,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">Now (ſaid he) I have gone through the hardeſt of my task, Heavens grant I may with as much eaſe perform the Rights of Wedlock, I have but two or three Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations yet to make to all the powers of the world, and then I ſhall have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly accompliſht all was order'd me: That done, I ſhall try if I can taſte thoſe ſweets, which moſt men elſe enjoy; Ha <hi>Lauretta</hi> (continued he, caſting ſome amorous glances towards the Caſtle) Thou ſhalt have no cauſe hereafter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach me of being fit for nothing but to ſleep and ſnore by thy warm ſide; My body ſhall lye no longer like a ſenſleſſe block in bed with thee; Hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it will be ſo vigorous and youthful, that I ſhall weary thee, and thou wilt be inforc'd to ſay, (puſhing me gently back with thy ſoft hands) <hi>Oh my Dear, Oh my Sweet-heart, it's enough for this time.</hi> How joyfull ſhould I be to hear ſuch melting language from thy lips, inſtead of thoſe harſh tearms thou doſt commonly uſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>While he was thus diſcourſing to himſelf, his ſteps conducted him into a great incloſure full of all ſorts of trees, where he opened the bundle he had brought from home. In it there was a long black Caſſack which he put over his gowne, and a great riding hood with a Mask of the ſame piece, which muffled his head and face all over. In this Antick dreſs, as if he had been to act a jack-Pudding's part upon a ſtage, he began to practiſe the remaining part of his Magick Ceremonies, believing that the onely meanes to make him maſter of his deſires. <hi>Firſt</hi> he drew a Circle upon the ground, then reduced it to a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular figure with a ſtaffe tipt with iron; but being ready to ſtep into the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, a ſuddaine ſhivering ſeazed upon all his limbs, Feare ſuggeſting to his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled thoughts that the Devills would preſently leave their infernall Manſions and appeare to him. He would have ſigned himſelf with a Croſſe, had not he, who inſtructed him in the practiſe of theſe ſuperſtitions, expreſſely forbidden him to uſe it on this occaſion, and inſtead thereof had taught him certain words to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect him from any aſſaults, the evill ſpirits ſhould dare to make upon his perſon.</p>
            <p>The paſſion that inflamed his deſire to compleat his enterpriſe, arming his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution againſt all ſorts of conſideration, conſtrained him at length to proſtrate himſelf upon his bare knees in the midſt of the Circle with his face towards the Eaſt, and pronounce theſe words:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">Oh you ſpirits that rule Concupiſcence, fill our hearts with Carnall deſires at your will, and give us ability to performe them, (this he ſpake with an indifferent loud voyce) By the ſupream power, on which you are dependant, I conjure you to aſſiſt me in all incounters, ſupport, my infirmities, ſtrengthen my weakneſſe, and eſpecially I beſeech you render me as potent and valorous a Cambatant in <hi>Venus</hi> warres, as he that ſcarce hath reacht the ſeventh Luſter of his age: This is all I crave, and if you will vouchſafe to grant it, I'le carve you out ſo large a recompence, that you ſhall reſt ſatisfied with my gratitude.</q> This ſaid, he addreſſed ſeverall vowes to <hi>Aſmodeus,</hi> then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a good while ſilent in expectation of the event. At length a ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59287:8"/>noiſe poſted to his eare from a place not far diſtant, and lending better at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention he heard a fearfull howling, and a ſound like that of ſtints when ſtruck a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt each other, ſoon after a horrible dinne and ruſtling, as if ſomebody had haſted towards him through the Branches of the Trees. With this, feare took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his heart, and you may ſweare he wiſht himſelfe at home, and that he never had undertook ſo perillous an enterprize: yet after a little recollection his fancy had recourſe to theſe fooliſh words, which he was taught to ſay for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">Oh whatſoer'e thou beeſt, great Maſtiff, that runneſt towards me with open mouth and up-lifted taile, thinking to have found the Prey thou look'ſt for, returne to the place whence thou comeſt, and content thy ſelf to eat up thy great grand-mothers old ſhooes.</q> Theſe words are very ridiculous; and thoſe your principall Magitians uſe are little leſſe impertinent, ſo the ſimple old fellow might eaſily be perſwaded to give credit to them, He thought ſome grand Myſterie had layen concealed under theſe abſurdities, and ſpitting in his hand he put his little finger in his eare, with a multitude of other fopperies belonging to the Ceremony, which punctually performed, he believed the moſt maligne ſpirits of the world were forced rather to comply with his deſires, than doe him the leaſt injury. Immediately after this he diſcovered ſomething in humane ſhape not many paces from him: This he took to be the Devill whom he had invok'd, and not daring to move neither legs nor tongue, his Soule had made an eſcape out of its mortall priſon, had its flight not been retarded by theſe words: Valentine, <hi>I am thy friend, feare nothing, I will procure thee the perfect enjoyment of thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures thou moſt deſireſt, henceforwards onely cheriſh thy ſelfe, and take no farther care.</hi> This ſaid, the Spirit vaniſht, and with him all <hi>Valentine</hi>'s feare, his Agony being much abated by this favourable ſallutation.</p>
            <p>A Pilgrim (whoſe right name was <hi>Francion</hi>) had ordered him one trick more, which returning to his then more ſetled thoughts, he preſently repaired to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place he had deſigned for that experiment. Straight ſprung a fancy in his giddy braine, that he was already imbracing his faire <hi>Lauretta,</hi> this fed his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination with ſuch delight, that he could not forbeare hugging and tickling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe till he laught, with a thouſand other actions expreſſing an exceſſe of joy. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at length come to a great Elme tree, he caſt his Armes about it, as the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim had adviſed him: in this poſture he repeated divers prayers, which ended, he turned his body to embrace the other part of the tree, muttering theſe words to himſelfe: <hi>It will be as eaſie for me to content my wife, (ſince heaven is ſo pleaſed) as to incompaſſe this Elme with my imbraces.</hi> But while he was humouring his fond deſires with this amorous contemplation, he felt on a ſodaine ſomething take hold on both his hands, and notwithſtanding he ſtruggled with all the ſtrength Nature had lent him, he found no poſſibility of releaſement: They were inſtantly bound faſt together with a ſtrong cord, and he ſtretching out his neck like the Cock of a Conduit, whoſe head is not ſixt to the body, but may be ſet higher or lower at pleaſure, ſtood looking about to ſee if he could diſcover who had put that abuſe upon him.</p>
            <p>Mean time fear had ſo multiplyed the ſpecies of each object, that inſtead of one Man (who (after he had thus made him priſoner) conveyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe immediately into the thickeſt of the Wood) he thought he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at leaſt fifty, and (which more terrified his affrighted Soule) that they were ſo many evill Spirits aſſembled there meerly to rejoyce at his torments, and make him ſuffer all the perfecutions they could deviſe. To cry out he durſt not, to implore any ſuccour he conceived in vaine, for he believed it impoſſible for him ever to be delivered thence without the divine aſſiſtance; beſides, if he ſhould complaine, for ought he knew thoſe mercileſſe Devills would redouble his puniſhment, and deprive him of the uſe of ſpeech, or tranſport him into ſome inhabitable Deſart. His Body enjoyed as little quiet as his Mind; for ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to free himſelf of that captivity, he marcht inceſſantly about the Elme, and ſo
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59287:9"/>travelled like a Mill-horſe a great way in a little compaſſe, being not able to break nor pull it up by the roots, which he oft in vaine attempted.</p>
            <p>Then he began to repent at leiſure of his folly for uſing Magick Art, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring he had heard the Parſon of his Pariſh ſay,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">No man ought to exerciſe that damn'd profeſſion, unleſſe he had a mind to boyle eternally in the Devills Kettle.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Meane time the faire <hi>Lauretta,</hi> whom he left in the Caſtle, entertain'd as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſleep as her diſtracted Husband; for the devout Pilgrim <hi>Francion</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to viſit her that night by the help of a cord-ladder ſhe had faſtened to the window; and ſhe feaſted her wanton thoughts with a confidence that he would give her a reall taſt of thoſe delights, whereof her Husband never had the ability to ſhew her the <hi>Idea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You muſt note, that four Thieves having not long before received intelligence of divers very rich movables in the Caſtle (whereof
<hi>Valentine</hi> was Keeper) had combined to robb it, and the better to atchieve their enterprize, they diſguiſed the youngeſt of their Gang (being a handſome fellow) in Womans cloathes, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing him to contrive ſome meanes to intrude himſelf into that family, and as a Domeſtick to obſerve the places where the beſt Booty lay, and ſecure the keyes if poſſible, that they might take away what they pleaſed. This Thief aſſuming a name ſuitable to his habit, comes a begging to the Caſtle, poſſeſſes <hi>Valentine</hi> with a belief that ſhe was a poor Orphan, her father having been hanged for ſome falſly impoſed Crimes, and that ſhe had abandoned her native Country, being too ſenſible of the infamy would reflect upon her for her Fathers diſgracefull death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valentine,</hi> moved with compaſſion at the recitall of the misfortunes of this counterfeit <hi>Katherine</hi> (ſo ſhe called her ſelfe) and ſeeing ſhe offered to ſerve without contracting for wages, willingly gave her admittance into his houſe. Her compliance and readineſſe to ſerve her Miſtreſſe, with the modeſt and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe countenance ſhe had ſo cunningly compoſed, had ſoon purchaſed her ſo large a portion of <hi>Lauretta</hi>'s favour, that ſhe intruſted the management of her whole houſhold to her care. And her credit grew by degrees to that height, that ſhe might freely take the keyes of any Roome and keep them long enough ere they were re-demanded, or any body entertain'd the leaſt ſuſpition of her fidelity.</p>
            <p>One day going to fetch water at a ſpring without the Village, ſhe met one of her aſſociates, who came to inform himſelfe of her proceedings while the other ſtayed at the next town, expecting a favourable opportunity to accompliſh their deſigne. She aſſured him if they came privately thither the night following, they might load themſelves with divers things of value ſhe then had in her power, promiſing withall to caſt them out the cord-ladder one of them had conveyed into her hands not above two dayes before.</p>
            <p>The three Thieves failed not a minute of the time appointed, and being deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the bottom of the Caſtle ditch, they ſpied a hand guiding a cord-ladder out at a window, on the ſide towards the great gate. One of them by a gentle whiſtle gave notice of their approach, the like ſignall was returned from above: This drew all their eyes immediately to the window, where they perceived a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whom they ſuppoſed to be their Confederate, <hi>Katharine,</hi> though that was not the place ſhe had appointed them to ſcale. One of the three (named <hi>Oliver</hi>) touhc'd, with I know not what remorſe of Conſcience, took a ſerious review of all his paſt Extravagancies, and growing ſtill more ſenſible of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of his Soul, had a few dayes before made a ſolemne Vow to Heaven within himſelfe, to abandon that lewd Company and amend his life; But his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions having need of his aſſiſtance (being of an active Body and notable Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage) would not be perſwaded, by all the intreaties he could make, to let him <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59287:9"/>quit their conſortſhip, but ſealed their threats with execrable oathes, if he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to deſert them before they had rob'd that Caſtle, where-ever he retired they nere would be at reſt till they had found meanes to murther him. Yet ſeeing them like greedy Wolves, ready to faſten upon the Prey, he again told them,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">As he deſired no part of the Booty they were going to make, ſo he would have no ſhare of the trouble and danger they might undergoe.</q> But after much reviling language, being taxed with feare and cowardiſe for denying his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, at length he was conſtrained to mount the ladder, firſt, to avoid the fury of his inraged Camarades.</p>
            <p>Stepping from the Window into the Chamber, he admired to ſee himſelfe fall into the amorous armes of a Woman, whom he found of another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution than <hi>Katherine.</hi> This was the Lady <hi>Lauretta,</hi> who took him for <hi>Francion,</hi> the darkneſſe of the Chamber deceiving her, for her candle had been long put out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oliver</hi> not inſenſible of this favour fortune had caſt upon him, thought he muſt ſpeedily hinder his companions aſcent, or they would interrupt his ſport, ſo, gently unlocking fair
<hi>Lauretta</hi>'s armes he haſted to the window, to take in the ladder, as ſhe deſired; and perceiving one of his aſſociates already faſt upon it, he ceaſed not drawing till he was at leaſt half way up, then tying it to an iron hinge, he ſhut the window cloſe. The Thief thinking
<hi>Oliver</hi> intended to draw him in that manner to the top, at firſt was no way troubled; but finding a ſtop in the middle of his courſe, he began to entertaine ſome jealous thoughts, and accuſe thoſe within of treachery. Nevertheleſſe he climb'd up the ladder to <hi>Lauretta</hi>'s window, but perceiving no poſſibilty of entrance, and not daring to knock, leſt ſome of the Caſtle ſhould diſcover him, he fancied it would be his beſt way to recover the ground againe: In this opinion he ſlid along the cord as low as it would reach (which was nothing neare the bottom) and falling thence by a window fenced with Iron Barrs, one of the pointed ends running through, made him ſo faſt Priſoner by the breeches, that all the art he had could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him the liberty to break his neck by tumbling any farther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion</hi> in this interim not willing to neglect the aſſignment his Miſtreſſe had given him, failed not to come to the Caſtle-wall, where ſeeing on the other ſide, <hi>Katherine</hi> with a ladder at the window, he preſumed it was <hi>Lauretta.</hi> In this confidence he preſently mounts to the top, and being entred the roome, his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was nothing but an iteration of kiſſes to his ſuppoſed Miſtreſſe. She won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at his fond familiarity, ſaid,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">
                  <hi>Oliver,</hi> What's the matter? Is it thou, or is it ſome other? What, art become a fool, to play ſuch antick tricks when we ſhould rather be diligent in the expedition of our buſineſſe? Leave, I muſt help up thy fellowes. Doſt think my change of habit hath made me transform my ſex.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion</hi>'s opinion that he had miſtook his mark, was perfectly confirmed by theſe words, which came not (as his eares quickly diſcover'd) from the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mouth of his beloved <hi>Lauretta.</hi> However he ſtood not to examine what the true meaning was, becauſe he thought they concerned him not; onely he told <hi>Katherine</hi> (whom he then knew to be the maid) that her Miſtreſſe had promiſed to dedicate that night to <hi>Venus</hi> in his company, and he was come to enjoy the precious contentment of her ſweet embraces. <hi>Katherine,</hi> who had as much cunning as was requiſite for any that exerciſed the trade ſhe profeſſed, ſearcht among all her ſubtileſt projects for an invention to get cleare of him, imagining his preſence would put a ſtop to their deſigne. To conduct him to <hi>Lauretta</hi>'s chamber (as he deſired) ſhe deemed not convenient, becauſe ſhe thought perhaps ſhe might be commanded to ſtand Centinell, or be otherwiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed when her companions came to execute their intention. So, to avoid all incumbrance, ſhe told him her Miſtreſſe was very ſick, and had given her charge
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59287:10"/>to plead her excuſe for deferring her appointed entertainment. <hi>Francion,</hi> curſing the croſſeneſs of his fate, was forc'd to repeat his way to the rope, and being half way down,
<hi>Katherine</hi> (whoſe treacherous ſoul delighted in wicked acts) to revenge the accidentall check ſhe conceived his coming had given to their contrivance, ſhook the cord with all the force her rage could lend her, on purpoſe to ſend him to the ground head-long. Seeing himſelf thus treated, he perceived there was no remedy but leaping, to ſave his limbs from being ſhattered to pieces againſt the wall. This conſideration made him preſently quit his hold, and commit his life to torture, who lending no favourable aſſiſtance to his amorous ſtealths, but ſuffering him to tumble into the Tub (where <hi>Valentine</hi> had made his Bath) he had like to have met with two deaths in avoiding one; for, beſides making a great wound in his head, that bereaved him of both ſpeech and ſence, he wanted not much of drowning: <hi>Katherine</hi> hearing the noiſe he made, falling foule upon the Tub, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced within her ſelf at his diſaſter, and ſoon after drew in the ladder, believing her companions would not come that night.</p>
            <p>The Thief that ſtayed below, ſeeing <hi>Oliver</hi> (who had got into the Caſtle) look't no more after him, and that his other Camarade was ſo hung in the Aire, that there was no poſſibility of relieving him, expected no good iſſue of their Plot, concluding, if his fellow were found hanging next morning in that poſture, he ſhould gaine nothing by ſtaying with him, but the ill fortune to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to beare him company on another Gallowes. However, a certaine blinde and groundleſs curioſity inviting him to walk round the Ditch, he advances to <hi>Franci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>'s Tub, and feeling a Man in it, he dragg'd him by the Armes out of the Water; Then, his Neceſſity (with the naturall inclination he had to pilfering) reviving his deſire of prey, made him preſently dive into the ſtrangers pockets, where he found a Purſe full of <hi>Carducu</hi>'s and other money, with a Ring that had ſo rich a luſtre, that maugre the Nights obſcurity, you might perceive its beauty. This happy incounter ſomewhat qualified his former diſcontents, and without taking farther care, whether the Man he robb'd were alive or dead, or inquiring what accident had brought him thither, he preſently left that place, reſolving to wander as his Starres ſhould direct him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oliver,</hi> who had a jewell in poſſeſſion of far greater value than his fellow-Thief, reſolved to injoy it to the full, and drowne his deſires in delight, having firſt ſhut the Chamber windows cloſe, leſt the injurious Light, finding an entrance there, ſhould too ſoon betray him: <hi>Lauretta</hi> with an affected wantonneſſe had careleſly throwne her ſelfe againe upon her Bed, expecting her Champion, who began his skirmiſh with ſo hot a charge of kiſſes, as left no ſpace for Words. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this firſt Aſſault, ſhe, whom the exceſſe of Pleaſure had before ſtruck dumb, ſoon recovered the uſe of ſpeech, and putting her Armes about his Neck, and her moiſt Lips to his Cheeks, Eyes and Mouth, broke ſilence with theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations: <hi>Oh! deare</hi> Francion, <hi>how much ſweeter is thy Converſation, than that old doting fellow's, whom I have been forc't to marry! O how winning are thy Charmes! how great thy merit! How happy doe I'eſteeme my ſelfe for having the wit to diſcerne, and be taken with thy perfections! I ſhall never deſire to be looſed from that pretious Chaine. Thou doſt not speake (my deare)</hi> continued ſhe, with a kiſſe more ardent than the former, <hi>Is it becauſe my company ſeems not ſo agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thee as thine to me? Alas, if it were ſo, I ſhould indure penalty enough by my imperfections.</hi> Then after a ſhort ſilence, ſhe added; <hi>O! really I muſt accuſe my ſelfe of folly for putting out my Candle; for, what need I have fear'd? the old fellow's gone forth (I thinke) to practiſe the remedies thou taughtſt him for his incurable diſeaſes: I muſt call to</hi> Katherine <hi>for a light, I am not altogether of the opinion of thoſe, who hold the myſteries of Love are to be perform'd i'th darke, I'm certaine, the ſight of the beloved object contributes new fuel to lovers fires; beſides, to be plaine with thee, (my deare heart) I would gladly ſee the Emerald thou promiſedſt to bring me, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59287:10"/>thou haſt ſo much care to comply with thy owne ingagement and my fancy, that thou haſt not forgot it; haſt thou? tell me really.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing could excuſe <hi>Oliver</hi> from diſcovering himſelfe, being conjured ſo oft to ſpeak, as if he had been
<hi>Francion:</hi> But imagining <hi>Lauretta</hi> would be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly diſpleaſed when ſhe found her ſelfe deceived, he determined to uſe all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible meanes to pacifie her. So he aroſe, and having a reaſonable good wit he proſtrated himſelfe upon his knees before her, with theſe words: Madam, <hi>I am infinite ſorry you are deceiv'd, taking me for another; Truly, had not your Careſſes ſet an edge upon my appetite, I ſhould not ſo eaſily have fallen into the crime I have committed; How ever inflict upon me what puniſhment you pleaſe, I am ready to receive your doome; knowing my life and death are both at your dispoſall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This voice differing much from <hi>Francions,</hi> made
<hi>Lauretta</hi> preſently perceive her errour. Then Shame and Anger took ſuch poſſeſſion of her Minde, that had ſhe not conſidered, what was done could not againe be undone, ſhe had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably been tranſported to ſome extream diſtemper. But the moſt pleaſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy ſhe could apply to that ſore, was to conſider, that he, whom ſhee took for
<hi>Francion,</hi> had given her a taſte of ſuch delicates as ſhe could not repent the pleaſure of enjoying them, nor <hi>Francion</hi> himſelfe, perchance, have furniſht bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. However ſhe feigned her ſelf much diſpleaſed, asking <hi>Oliver,</hi> with an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry tone, who he was. And ſeeing he anſwered her not immediately, <hi>Wicked Wretch,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>art not thou one of</hi> Francions <hi>Servants? haſt thou not murther'd thy Maſter to come hither in his place? Madam,</hi> (reply'd
<hi>Oliver,</hi> remaining ſtill upon his knees) <hi>I'le aſſure you I know not that</hi> Francion <hi>you speake of: To give you an account who I am, I ſhall doe is freely, ſo you promiſe to believe what I ſhall tell you, and let me ſuffer if I speak any thing but truth. Goe on,</hi> ſaid
<hi>Lauretta, I doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe it, but be briefe in your relation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>You have a Maid</hi> (continued he) <hi>called</hi> Katherine,
<hi>who hath partly been the cauſe of this adventure, and if your patience will permit, I ſhall acquaint you how: You are deceived in believing her a Maid, Shee's of the contrary ſexe, onely diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Womans Cloaths on purpoſe, to give Thieves entrance here to rob you, and this night ſhe promiſed to caſt a Cord-ladder out of a Window, to facilitate their aſcent. The diſorders of my youth invited me to leave my Fathers houſe, and ranke my ſelf in company with theſe thieves, but I have framed a reſolution a few dayes ſince, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh their abhominable Courſe of life. Nevertheleſſe meeting with the ladder you had prepared for</hi> Francion, <hi>and taking it to be</hi> Katharine<hi>'s, I was forced to come up firſt, yet Heaven in my witneſſe, I had no intent to aſſiſt them in the Robberie, but rather to diſcover their plot to any I ſhould chance to meet, and ſo prevent the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. To confirme your beliefe,</hi> Madam,
<hi>be pleaſed onely to caſt your eye from the Window downwards, and you ſhall ſee one of the thieves hanging upon the Cord, which I have halfe drawne up; This is a cleare teſtimony, that had I complyed with their villanious intentions, I ſhould not have uſed him in that manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lauretta</hi> moved with admiration at theſe words, went preſently to ſatisfie her naturall curioſity, and peeping through a little Window, ſhe perceived what <hi>Oliver</hi> had told her was no lye, ſo ſhe demanded no further proof of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, but longing to know how
<hi>Katherine</hi> was imployed, ſhe called her to bring a light, having firſt hid <hi>Oliver</hi> betwixt the Bed and Wall. <hi>Katherine</hi> by the helpe of the Candle ſhe brought lighted, having a full view of
<hi>Lauretta</hi>'s naked Boſome, was tickled with deſires much more fervent than ſuch ſights doe uſually awake in perſons of her habit. The abſence of her Maſter, and the good humour ſhe thought her Miſtriſſe then was in, added Confidence to her Luſt: for
<hi>Lauretta,</hi> hiding the hatred ſhe conceived againſt her, under a ſmooth and ſmiling Countenance, with, a pretty familiarity thus began;
<q rend="inline margQuotes">Whence comeſt thou,
<hi>Katherine,</hi> what not unready yet, and 'tis ſo late? I proteſt
<hi>(Madam anſwered ſhe)</hi> I cannot ſleep, I am alwayes afraid of Spirits or Thieves, lying in a ſolitary corner far from all company, therefore I ſeldome put off my <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59287:11"/>Clothes, that in caſe any thing ſhould happen, I may not be forced to come out of my chamber naked to call for ſuccour: but is it poſſible, <hi>Madam,</hi> you ſhould be here alone without any feare? Oh God! I beſeech you let me ſtay here all night, ſince my Maſter is not at home: I ſhall ſleep better upon this ſtoole, than in my bed, and I ſhall be ſo far from diſturbing you, that you will finde much convenience by my being ſo neare and ready to give you immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately any thing you ſhall demand. No, No, (reply'd <hi>Lauretta</hi>) returne to thy own chamber, I have no need of thee, &amp; ſince I have a light I ſhall be no more afraid; Onely in the dark, if any thing breaks my ſleep on a ſuddaine, feare preſents ſtrange apparitions to my fancy, ſometimes in forme of a Dog, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times like a man all in black, and ſometimes in ſhapes more deformed and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible. Here <hi>Katherine,</hi> fleering in her Miſtreſſe face, thus interrupted her, "Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
<hi>Madam,</hi> your husband is very unnaturall, Ah Heavens! how could he reſolve to leave your company this night? Where is he? is he gone to catch Frogs with a quaile-pipe? For my particular (though I am held but a ſilly Wench) I muſt confeſſe to you, I finde my ſelfe more capable of loving you, than he appeares to be. Get thee gone, thou art an abſurd foole,
<hi>ſaid Lauretta;</hi> how now? It ſeems when you came hither firſt, you did but play the Hypocrite: whom ſhall we truſt hereafter? Don't you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me then? <hi>(replyed Katherine)</hi> well, but ſuppoſe I ſhould ſhew you in effect that I am provided of the inſtrument you moſt want, and that <hi>Valentine</hi> cannot render a better account of his abilities than I; Would you not thinke it ſtrange? This is handſome diſcourſe indeed for a Maid, (<hi>anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> Lauretta <hi>angerly</hi>) Goe, Huſſy, thou art the boldeſt quean in the World, where haſt thou got tipple to make thy ſelfe drunke this night? Be gone, and ſee my face no more. 'Tis a miſerable thing to have to doe with ſuch people, as many Servants, as many Enemies: But what remedy? they are neceſſary Evills.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Katherine,</hi> whoſe ſpirits were then raiſed, and would not be layed by the frownes of a ſeeming unwillingneſſe, not caring what opinion her Miſtreſſe could have of her familiarity, ſawcily advanced to kiſſe her, and give her a perfect aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that ſhe had boaſted of nothing more than ſhe was able and ready to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: for, ſhe imagined, as ſoon as ſhe had ſhewen her evidence to
<hi>Lauretta,</hi> her anger would turne to kindneſſe, &amp; ſeek no farther then that offered opportunity, with open armes to deliver up loves fortreſſe. But <hi>Lauretta</hi> apprehending what Diſcretion injoyned, was ſo far from being her owne Bawde in the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her luſtfull deſignes, as ſhe flew into a ſtorme of bitter language, which back't with three or foure blows, drove her out of the chamber.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oliver</hi> who had heard all their diſcourſe, came out of his Ambuſcade behinde the Bed, and told <hi>Lauretta</hi> ſhe might now eaſily underſtand by the words and actions of <hi>Katherine,</hi> that ſhe was not what ſhe repreſented. <hi>Lauretta</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this apparent truth, anſwered, ſhe would now ſo narrowly watch
<hi>Katherine</hi>'s proceedings, as when ſhe leaſt ſuſpected the prevention, her fellow-thieves ſhould not onely be denyed their expected entrance into the Caſtle, but ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a juſt puniſhment for her treachery. Conſider, <hi>Madam,</hi> what is fitteſt to be done (ſaid
<hi>Oliver</hi>) and I promiſe to ſhape my aſſiſtance by the Patterne of your commands. I'le goe ſeek out <hi>Katherine</hi> (replyed
<hi>Lauretta</hi>) follow you onely at a diſtance, and be ready to come up with theſe cords when you heare me call, that we may bind her as I ſhall contrive it. This ſaid, <hi>Lauretta</hi> took the candle and went to her maids Chamber,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">here take the light (ſaid ſhe) and come with me into the great hall. What to doe? <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid
<hi>Katherine,</hi> take you no care for that replyed <hi>Lauretta</hi>) you ſhall ſee when you are there.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When they were come into the hall, <hi>Lauretta</hi> bade
<hi>Katherine</hi> open the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and get up to ſee what it was hung a top of the grate and made ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent buſtling. This was the Thief whom accident had apprehended by the haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59287:11"/>
               <hi>Katherine,</hi> who was ignorant of her Complice's being there arreſted, after ſhe had taken the liberty to foole with her Miſtreſſe's breaſts, ſet her foot upon a low ſtoole, and thence ſtept into the window, to ſatisfie her owne, as well as
<hi>Lauretta</hi>'s curioſity. She had no ſooner ſet her ſelfe into a poſture to make the diſcovery, but <hi>Lauretta</hi> mounting into a great Chaire, laid hold on both her hands, while <hi>Oliver</hi> (who waited for the ſignall at the doore) pinioned her armes behind, and bound her faſt to the croſſe-barre. This is not all (ſaid <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta,</hi> laughing, when ſhe ſaw her perſon was ſecured) We muſt ſee if her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities be ſo good as ſhe boaſted: With that, ſhe hoiſted up her Petticoats, Smock and all, and tyed it to her Boſome with a Point, expoſing her whole Packet to the publick view. Then <hi>Oliver</hi> began to jeere and laugh ſo loud, that his Companion and <hi>Katherine</hi> both knowing his voice, one cryed,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">Ah! I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee help me to get off this Broach, for Day is almoſt ready to break, and if I am found in this condition here, I give thee leave to judge what will become of me. I can lend thee no aſſiſtance (anſwered <hi>Oliver</hi>) for here's a great iron grate betwixt us; But thou doſt very well to wiſh thy ſelfe out of the Aire, for that's an Element very contrary to thy Conſtitution, and I am confident 'twill be thy Deſtiny to die in it. Thou haſt betrayed us then (ſaid <hi>Katherine,</hi> interrupting him) Perfidious Villaine, if I had hold of thy heart, I would devoure it preſently. Talk no more of
<hi>Holding</hi> (replyed <hi>Oliver</hi>) for thou haſt no uſe of thy
<hi>hands.</hi> Let's leave them there (ſaid <hi>Lauretta</hi>) to complaine and raile their fills, no body ſhall come to relieve them but the Sergeant and the Hangman.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This diſcourſe ended, <hi>Lauretta</hi> invited
<hi>Oliver</hi> back to her Chamber, where having better opportunity to contemplate her perfections, he was raviſhed at the delicacie of her complexion, which he little thought was ſo tranſcendent when he enjoyed her in the dark. After admiring the attraction and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring power of her eyes, he ventured to taſte the Cherries of her lips; which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour was not refuſ'd him: for, <hi>Lauretta</hi> ſeeing his garbe and Perſon not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome, was nothing unwilling to let him recommence the Game, wherein at their firſt encounter he had ſo well played his part. And he (who was no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the art of Love) reading the intentions of her yeilding heart in the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton motion of her craving eyes, neglected not the favourable opportunity was given him, to pleaſe his appetite with a ſecond taſte of ſo delicious a Banquet.</p>
            <p>The recreations of their bodies paſt, they began to give ſome liberty to their tongues; <hi>Oliver</hi>'s chief diſcourſe was of the happineſſe Fortune had unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly throwne upon him, aſſuring
<hi>Lauretta</hi> with the repetition of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Oathes, that he eſteemed nothing, the whole Univerſe conteined, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the contentment he received in her company.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">You have good reaſon to return thanks to th' Heavens for one thing (ſaid <hi>Lauretta</hi> And that is, for being ſo propitious to your intents, that when I ſaw you at the middle of the Ladder, coming up (taking you for a ſervant of mine) I retired, and ſet my ſelfe in a Chaire expecting till you were got through the Window; for, had I ſtayed there, I ſhould ſoon have perceived you were not the man I look't for, and (not to conceale the truth) you had infallibly found a very bad rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, whereas now your entertainment has been ſuch as (I believe) you have little cauſe to complaine. I doubt not (anſwered <hi>Oliver</hi>) but you would have ill-treated me, and I cannot blame you, if you had; for, what inclinations could you have for a man unknowne ſurpriſing you in that manner, inſtead of one whoſe company you had frequented and affected? But I ſhall beg your belief of this Proteſtation; If I am not equall in parts of Body or Mind to him, whom you intended this night to honour with your embraces, I may compare with him, if not exceed him, in affection and deſires to ſerve you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe demonſtrations of a fervent Love open'd the way to divers other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, which now and then were interrupted with ſome amorous Dalliances, <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59287:12"/>the delights whereof they repeated as oft as the Spirit moved.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Lauretta</hi> ſaw the over-early Sun dart in his prying rayes through the Crannies of her chamber Window, ſuſpecting by that time her husband was ready to returne, ſhe adviſed <hi>Oliver</hi> to hide himſelf among the Hay in the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and when the Draw-bridge was let downe, take his opportunity to ſlip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. After divers ſweet Adieu's, and an infinity of aſſurances to regiſter her favours in his memory, he conſented to follow her directions, and made his Neſt in the Mowe, while ſhe returning to her Chamber lock'd her ſelf within, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the ſucceſſe of <hi>Katherine</hi> and her confederate's Adventure.</p>
            <p>This being Sunday Morning, Three luſty Countrey ladds had got up betimes to goe to the firſt Maſs, and afterwards to a Village not farre thence to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge at long Tennis the beſt gameſters of the place: But finding the Church doores ſhut, and the Curate not yet ſtirring, they tooke occaſion to walk about the Caſtle, where they preſently perceived the Thief holding the Cord-ladder with one hand, and the Iron grate with the other; the next object they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered was <hi>Katherine</hi> ſtark naked from the waſte downwards, and taking her for an Hermaphrodite, they burſt out into ſuch loud laughters and ſhouting, as made the whole Village ring with their rude noiſe. This waked the Curates cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to deſcend, (buttoning his Doublet as he went) and ſee what Novelty caus'd that wondrous merryment. But their emotion was ſo extravagant, that they could hardly keep themſelves upon their feet, and did nothing but clap their hands, wreſt their bodies into a hundred antick poſtures, and joult one another, as if they had been little leſſe than mad. The good Paſtour caſting his eyes onely upon them, perceived no cauſe of ſuch exceſſive laughter, and though he never ceaſed asking what the matter was, for a good while could draw no other anſwer from them but a redoubling of their cries and laughter: At length, taking one by the arm, "Come hither <hi>Peter</hi> (ſaid he) prethee tell "me what may be the reaſon of this tranſportment. All theſe words the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low (holding his ſides with both his hands, and laughter often interrupting his ſpeech) bad him look at one of the Caſtle windowes. The Curate directing his ſight that way, quickly diſcerned what had put them in that abſurd humour, and with a moderate ſmile, that no way diſcompoſed his gravity,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">You are a company of right Lobcocks (ſaid he) to make ſuch a monſtrous clamour for ſo ſlight a matter; It is a ſign you have ſeen but little, ſince the meaneſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in the world incites you to ſuch boundleſſe laughter and deportments, befitting none but Bedlamites; I muſt confeſſe I laugh too, but 'tis at your folly: What know you but that you ſcoffe ſo at, may rather require your compaſſion, We ſhall hear anon by Mr. <hi>Valentine,</hi> what the meaning of this May-game is, perchance there has been ſome tragedie acted within his houſe this Night.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As the Curate had ended his ſpeech, he was accoſted by a great number of his towneſ-men, who wondring at this ſtrange ſpectacle fell to examining the Thief and <hi>Katherine,</hi> who had put them in that poſture, but they not ſo ready, nor willing to render them an account, were much perplexed within themſelves, they had ſo many witneſſes of their ſhame. At length upon further inſtance, the Thief promiſed, if they would procure his releaſment, he would tell them every particular: But the Curate charged them that accompanied him not to help him off his tenters till the Caſtle gates were opened, and he had ſpoke with <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine;</hi> ſo ſome of the rout rounding the Caſtle to ſee if they could ſpie any body at the windowes, a mournfull voice piercing their Eares, invited their Eyes to the bottom of the Ditch, where at firſt ſight they diſcerned a tub, and more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſurveying the circumjacent place, they ſaw
<hi>Francion,</hi> who after recovering of his ſwoun, felt himſelfe ſo cold and feeble, that his leggs not retaining ſtrength enough to ſupport his bruiſed body, he had laid himſelfe down by it to repoſe. The Clowns ſeeing him in a ſad condition, ſome of them ran down to him, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59287:12"/>one of them helping him up, and wiping the blood a little off his face, much ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed cryed out,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">
                  <hi>Mercy Heavens!</hi> this is my Lodger, the devout Pilgrim that came to my houſe a while ſince; deare friend (continued he, looking ſtill ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly upon him) What treacherous Villains were thoſe handled you in this barbarous manner? Carry me hence (replyed <hi>Francion</hi>) good friends lend me your hands, I cannot now give you ſatisfaction in what you demand.</q> This ſaid, the Country-men lifted him out of the Ditch, and as they were carrying him to his Inne, they met one of his Servants, who wondered to ſee his Maſter in that equipage; the ſervice he judged then moſt expedient for him, was to run preſently for a Chirurgion, who came as he was undreſt by the fire-ſide &amp; ready to be put in bed. The wound ſearcht was not found very dangerous, ſo after the application of ſome vulnerary Salves proper in like occaſions, the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion aſſured him it would be no long cure.</p>
            <p>While great numbers of the Country people ſtood gazing before the Caſtle, and wondering at the ſodain Metamorphoſis of a Maid into a Man; Some that had glutted themſelves with the pleaſure of this Drollery, went to bid their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours haſten to the Caſtle-green, and they ſhould ſee ſomewhat worth their labour. The beſt was, the Women (who have naturally more curioſity than Men, eſpecially in matters of recreation) earneſt beyond meaſure to know what their husbands were gone to ſee, ran by troops (like Cowes when ſtung by Gad flyes in the heat of Summer) to the place where the Comedie was act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But when they ſaw the ſhew
<hi>Katherine</hi> made, they turn'd back with as much ſhame as haſte; Some that were of a joviall humour, by their inceſſant tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ſeem'd diſtracted for the time; Others, whoſe auſterer diſpoſition made them peeviſh, and wreſt every thing to the worſt ſenſe, expreſs'd no ſmall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſte, and went muttering away, as if all this had been prepared meerly to abuſe them.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">Could you chooſe no other time to play your Apiſh Gambals but on a Sunday morning (ſaid one of theſe good Women to the Company) yet had you ſtaid till after Service it had been a little more tolerable, eſpecially if it were now <hi>Carneval</hi>-time: Ha! the World will periſh without doubt, ſo many Men, ſo many

            </p>
            <p>Divers ſuch jeers were caſt upon the poor Women, but Ile aſſure you they were not much behind hand with the Men, at leaſt if their retorts were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo ſmart, they charged them with ſo many rayling and injurious Words, and ſet up ſuch a Note, ſtraining their throats all together to cry as loud as ever they could, that the Men made dizzy with the noiſe were forced to quit the field, as confeſſing themſelves vanquiſhed.</p>
            <p>Some of this rout ſcattering from the reſt of their troop; chanced to wander into the Cops where <hi>Valentine</hi> was, and hearing a man cry out, they made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the place whence the voice ſeemed to come, little imagining 'twas he. With what amazement they were ſeized ſeeing this ſcare-crow covered with ſuch fantaſtick garments, and bound about the tree, is not eaſy to expreſſe. <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59287:13"/>With ſtriving and turmoiling himſelf in the Night, his hood was ſo fallen over his eyes, that he could not ſee ſo much as to diſcerne 'twas day: for want of his hands he often toſſed up his head to make it tumble backwards, but all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours were to little purpoſe. He could not ſee the Country-men, and onely hearing the noiſe they made in ſcoffing at the antick dreſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments of this Object (no leſs pleaſant than that they had ſeen at the Caſtle) the opinion he had all night that the Devils were preparing to torment him, came afreſh into his thoughts, and with a ſtronger apprehenſion than before: So imagining thoſe that approached him were no other than Devils, he began to repeat the remedies <hi>Francion</hi> had taught him to charm them.</p>
            <p>The Country-men knew him preſently by his voice, but hearing the fopperies and ſenſleſs words he ſpake, and conſidering the place and poſtures they found him in, they really believed he was beſide himſelf; ſo laughing, till thier girdles crack't, at theſe adventures, they ran back to give their Curate an account of their new diſcoveries. As he came with his guide into the Cloſe, ſpying alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Valentine</hi> among the trees,
"Is it you (Sir) my dear friend (ſaid he) alas! who is't has put you here?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valentine</hi> hearing his Paſtour's voice, began a little to moderate his fear, a fancy then coming in his crown, that the moſt deſperate of all the Devils in Hel would not dare to come near him ſo long as a ſacred perſon was with him; and after a little pauſe,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">Ah! good Sir (anſwered he) they were Devils that bound me here, and they have aſſailed me with more malice and fury than ever they perſecuted the holy ancient Hermites. But how (ſaid the Curate) Did you not lie in your own houſe this night? Did they bring you hither in ſuch manner as that you felt them not?</q> Were they not rather ſome wicked men that put you in this pickle? <hi>Valentine</hi> anſwered not a word, thinking he that ſpake to him might be a Devil himſelf, and had aſſumed a voice like his Curate's, purpoſely to deceive him: for he had heard and read that evil Spirits ſometimes transform themſelves into Angels of light. This made him begin his conjurations again, and after all, ſay,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">I will not ſpeak to thee, Prince of Darkneſſe, I know thee well enough, thou art not my Curate, thou onely imitateſt his Speech. But you ſhall ſee I am (anſwered the Curate taking off his hood) Why how now (Mr. <hi>Valentine</hi>) are you out of your wits, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all that ſpeak to you are Spirits? Why doe you forge theſe imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Muſt I put you in the number of my loſt ſheep?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valentine</hi> enjoying the benefit of the light, knew all thoſe about him were his neighbours and friends, and ſeeing they went about to ſet his hands at liberty, he abſolutely baniſhed the ill opinion he had conceived of them.</p>
            <p>When he was releaſed of his impriſonment, the Curate importun'd him ſo earneſtly to know how he came there, that he was conſtrain'd at length to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat all the inchantments <hi>Francion</hi> had taught him, and withall to relate the reaſon that incited him to practiſe them. Some knaviſh Boyes, that over-heard this ſtory, went preſently and publiſht it all the town over to his diſgrace, inſomuch that the memory of it is not yet extinct, and to this day, if there be any cold cod-pieced fellow, they tell him in a jeering manner, <hi>He muſt go to</hi> Valentines
<hi>Bath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the zealous Curat had ſufficiently rebuk'd his Pariſhioner for his pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous curioſity, they returned all together to behold the preſent ſpectacles at the Gaſtle windoes, whereof
<hi>Valentine,</hi> no leſs aſtoniſhed than the reſt, could render no account. Hereupon a merry conceited fellow, that by chance had mingled himſelf among them, replied,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">You are ſorely troubled, Gentlemen, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture the cauſe of what you ſee, Ile expound you this Riddle in three words; That Companion you ſee hanging by the Ladder, was ſome of
<hi>Katherine</hi>'s Sweet-hearts, and without doubt he had a purpoſe to go ſee her; But, to ſhew him his courtſhip was Labour in vain, ſhe has ſo cleared the point, that <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59287:13"/>his own eyes may certify him, ſhe is not as he thought her: Se how forlornly he looks, as if the loſs of his Love had bereav'd him of his Life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This fancy took the company extreamly, but they thought very ſodainly they ſhould receive more certain informations, in regard
<hi>Valentine</hi>'s ſervants were then opening the Caſtle gates; But they underſtood no more of all theſe myſteries, than if they had not belong'd to the Houſe.</p>
            <p>The Thief and <hi>Katherine</hi> were ſoon made looſe and brought before the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and <hi>Valentine,</hi> who failed not to ask them divers queſtions concerning their preſent condition, why and by whom they had been ſo expoſed. But the fear of a deſerved puniſhment had made them reſolve not to anſwer a ſyllable to any of their Interrogatories, knowing their cauſe was ſo tickliſh, that they were more like to foile than free themſelves by ſpeaking. <hi>Katherine</hi> was asked by divers,
"Since thou art a man, why doſt thou weare a Womans cloaths? But they might have ſaved their breath, for all the threats and perſwaſions they did uſe, could not draw one word from her mouth. <hi>Lauretta</hi> being come down ſeemed no leſs amazed than the reſt at the recitall all of theſe paſſages, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly withdrawing her ſelf by little and little into the Court (while every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy elſe were buſie in the Hall) ſhe haſted to re-viſite the Author of her laſt nights joyes, and after ſome cloſe embraces for a laſt farewell, ſhe conveyed him privately out of the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>The Juſtice of the place (who lived by miſchief and debates) not willing to loſe his <hi>Snip,</hi> was very earneſt in perſwading
<hi>Valentine</hi> to let him draw up infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations againſt thoſe offenders, urging the deſign of <hi>Katherine</hi> and her Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion could not be honeſt, and that they had attempted to rob him of his Goods or Honour. But <hi>Valentine,</hi> who not unacquainted with the malice of Law, was loth to render his purſe as a prey to ſuch ravenous Harpyes, refuſed to follow his advice, finding not any of his goods diminiſhed. All he deſired was to know by what accident thoſe Creatures came to be hung in that manner at his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes. The Juſtice, ſeeing there was nothing to be gained, would proceed no farther, for the Offenders could be drawne to no Confeſſion, neither were the Spectators able to charge them with any matter of fact. So, Morning Prayers paſt, the poore Thieves had liberty to ſteale themſelves out of the danger they apprehended. But for two or three Leagues they were purſued by ſuch multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of people, crying and ſhouting after, as rendred the perplexity and ſhame they indured no leſſe inſupportable than the ſevereſt puniſhment of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Thus they, whoſe perverſe inclinations lead them to wicked actions, never proſper in their undertakings, but receive a ſalary ſuteable to their Crimes, as the ſeverall paſſages here related teſtifie.</hi> Valentine, <hi>for the fooliſh curioſity that tranſported him to the Diabolicall practice of Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancie, became a ſcerne to all.

As for</hi> Francion, <hi>his vicious intention was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenc'd with harme enough, yet he reſolved to beare his misfortunes with more patience than the reſt.</hi>]</p>
            <p>While he was in bed, and his ſenſes well recovered, his man, who had been ſpectator of all the paſſages at the Caſtle, gave him an account of each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, at which he burſt into ſo violent a laughter, as made him forget his paine, yet his imagination could not penetrate the Thieves deſign, nor how they came to be ſo handſomely hung, though he remembred well enough <hi>Katherine</hi>'s <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59287:14"/>diſcourſe to him in her Chamber; But when he came to the recitall of <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine's</hi> conjurations, and in what equipage the Curate found him, his rapture was beyond expreſſion.</p>
            <p>As his Dinner was ſerving in, the Surgeon came to viſit him, and ſeeing Wine brought up, he told him, he muſt drink none, becauſe of the wound in his head.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">This is a very rigorous ſentence (replyed <hi>Francion</hi>) good friend deprive me not of that divine liquor, I prethee, It is the onely ſuſtenance of my body, all the delicateſt meats in the World are nothing comparable to it. Don't you know the pitifull Pretenders to Phyſick are commonly call'd <hi>freſh-water-Doctors</hi> becauſe they can doe nothing but preſcribe us that to drink? I believe their Prince <hi>Hippocrates</hi> was not of their opinion, for
<hi>Hypocras</hi> (which is the moſt excellent drink we have) has its name from him, either becauſe he loved it, or was the inventer of it. I knew a young Gentleman, who for ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, and a hurt in his leg, was forbidden Wine, as you do me, leſt it ſhould impair his diſeaſe: But what do you think he did? He laid himſelf in bed contrary to the ordinary uſe, and put his feet upon the pillow, that the fumes of the
<hi>Bacchicall</hi> liquor, he had plentifull exhauſted, might deſcend to his head. And for my part, ſince my wound is in the other extremity of my body, I think it were my beſt way to riſe and ſtand upright, to the end (ſeeing the Wine I ſhall then drink will rather deſcend to my feet than offend my head) you may not be ſo ſevere as to forbid it me.</q> This ſaid, <hi>Francion</hi> bade his man bring his clothes that he might riſe.</p>
            <p>The Country-Chirurgion willing to ſhew his skill, indeavoured to diſpoſſeſs him of that humour, and confute his reaſons, ſaying,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">They were grounded upon the Maximes of a Tippling-houſe rather than the Axioms of Phyſick;</q> Then he began to diſcourſe in terms of his own Art, which though barbarous and unknown, he conceited himſelf at the higheſt pitch of Eloquence when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced them, being infected with the diſeaſe of divers that believe their expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are then beſt when leaſt underſtood, not conſidering language is onely to make conceptions known, and he that has not the art to declare his meaning to all ſorts of perſons, is tainted with an ignorance not much leſſe than bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion</hi> having had the patience to heare him out, told him all his Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmes ſhould not hinder him from riſing, but he he would drink no Wine, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding (for mirth's ſake) he had maintained ſuch an Argument.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">Theſe are low poor ſpirited perſons (continued he) as have not the power to curb their paſſions, and ſubject their appetites to reaſon upon ſuch an account. For my particular, I muſt confeſs I am as great a lover of that liquor as any man, yet I can eaſily deny my ſelf the uſe of it, or any thing elſe I never ſo dearly-fancy. Your temper is very remarkable (replyed the Chirurgion) the power my ſoul has over my body, is nothing nere ſo abſolute; for I aſſure you, had <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> himſelf told me I ſhould prejudice my health in drinking wine, I could not refrain it, and without it, were I placed neer a fountaine of the moſt curious water imaginable, I ſhould periſh with thirſt.

The Chirurgion interrupting him, ſaid ſmiling, Sir, excuſe me if I ſay you oblige me now to credit the report is raiſed of you in this Village, which is, that you are very skilfull in matter of Magique; Otherwiſe you could never ſupport with ſo much patience the wounds you have receiv'd.

            </p>
            <p>This pleaſant imagination ſo tickled the fancy of our Patient, that he had like to have ſplit himſelfe with laughing. At length being cloath'd and ſet at Table with the Chirurgion (who was glad of the opportunity to dine upon his charge)
<q rend="inline margQuotes">But cannot you tell (began
<hi>Francion</hi>) whether I am ſtill in <hi>Valentine</hi>'s favour or not? in what tearmes does he ſpeak of me? Not to conceale the truth (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Chirurgion) he ſpeaks of you as of the wickedeſt Wizard in the world: He ſayes, whereas he expected your Receipts ſhould have done him ſome good, they have cauſed him an infinite deale of miſchiefe. Though he has been long aſſured of his owne inſufficiency, he would however make a tryall now to ſee if he could comport himſelfe in <hi>Cupid</hi>'s combat with his wife more vigorouſly than before; but alas! poore feeble fellow, he has got no credit by the attempt, his Standard falling when he ſhould have entred the breach; So at length he was conſtrained to contract a diſhonourable Peace with <hi>Lauretta.</hi> There is nothing but his Sally-port behind open; and that is ſo off the hooks, as it cannot retaine a liquid ſcurvy matter that eſcapes out every minute; Inſomuch as he has intreated me, being his Goſſip, to furniſh him with a drug to ſtop thoſe Overtures, and appeaſe the ſedition of thoſe inteſtine Rebels, who not obſerving the places ordered them, fly forth without asking leave.</q>

            <p>They were no ſooner riſen from the Board, but divers of the Inhabitants, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited with a curioſity to ſee <hi>Francion,</hi> came to his Inne, and asked Where's the Pilgrim? Where's the Pilgrim? with ſo loud a voice, that he could hear di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly what they ſaid. Immediately he bolts his chamber doore, and though they thruſt and knock'd againſt it, ſaying ſometimes they wanted a Coffer within that room, ſometimes they muſt ſpeak with the Chirurgion, they could finde no admittance. At length they ſwore there was a man in the Village ſo deſperately wounded, that he would die without the application of ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent remedy, and they would have the Chirurgion out; But as they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to force their entrance,
<hi>Francion</hi> and his man preſented themſelves at the doore with Piſtolls in each hand, proteſting they would diſcharge againſt whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould dare to break in upon them.</p>
            <p>The cowardly Clownes not accuſtomed to play upon ſuch Pipes, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to aſſault upon ſuch tearms, and going all away, gave the beſieged time enough to rebarricadoe their Avenues. A ſhort while after advances another troop, more numerous than the former, but returned with as little ſucceſſe as their companions. <hi>Francion</hi> exceedingly diſpleaſed at the importunities of theſe Churles, reſolved to get clear of them as ſoon as he could. So, having diſcharged the houſe, he communicates his intentions to his Hoſt, deſiring he would ſpare him a little Cart he had diſcovered ſtanding in his yard, to carry him to ſome other town, where he might be leſſe diſquieted. His Hoſt moved
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59287:15"/>with his intreaty, preſently ties two Hoops to the top of his Cart, upon them ſpreads a Coverled, and having laid all
<hi>Francion</hi>'s movables at the bottom, he advertiſed him it was then time to depart. The Pilgrim without delay mounts into the Cart, and places himſelf at his moſt eaſe upon a Bed of Straw, prepared purpoſely for his journey, while they drew him out of his lodging at a back gate into the open field, his Man followed immediately upon his Horſe, and in this Equipage they croſs'd the country without being diſcerned by any of that Village.</p>
            <p>Some of the ſilly Swaines returning to the Inne as ſoon as they were gone, and finding neither <hi>Francion</hi> nor his Man in his Chamber, nor any other part of the houſe, concluded preſently they were vaniſhed, and had conveyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of their ſight by the art of Necromancy.</p>
            <p>As they marched, <hi>Francion</hi> took occaſion to diſcourſe ſometimes with a young fellow that drove his Chariot, ſometimes with his Man, to whom he thus began,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">When I reflect upon the adventures befallen me this day, my fancy is ſo delighted with the lively repreſentation of the inſtability of things in this world, that I can hardly forbeare laughing; yet I am ſure I am in for my twenty Crowns and a Ring, which I have loſt I know not how.

Reflecting upon the name of <hi>Francion,</hi> he began to remember the perſonage he had frequented in his tender years: But his Actions and the lively deſcription of his humour gave better inſtructions to his Memory, than the lineaments of his feature. However he reſolved not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſo ſodainly the particular familiarities had formerly paſſ'd between them: At length wearied with variety of imaginations, he ſuffered his Spirits to ſubmit to the charmes of overcomming ſleep, which playing the gentle thief, ſoon rob'd him of both ſenſe and motion.</p>
            <p>In another Bed in the ſame chamber, lay a certain old Woman, who tired with travelling on foot, had taken up her lodging there, before any other company arrived: By this time her firſt ſleep was ended, and ſhe had loſt the power, aſwell as the deſire of ſleeping any more, when
<hi>Francion</hi> approach'd the Period of his Narration; ſo ſhe perceived he was a ſervant to the faire Dame <hi>Lauretta,</hi> of whom no body could give a better accompt than her ſelf: and had not wearineſſe and ſleep barricado'd up her ears when he began his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſhe might have learn't his name, which would have given her no leſſe cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of him: For ſhe had often heard him mentioned, and ſometimes ſeen him at the Court.</p>
            <p>So not knowing who he was, the deſire of being inform'd, and the curioſity ſhe had to ſee his face, not onely hindred her repoſe, but made her leave her Couch and ſtrike fire (with a little tinder-box ſhe bore about her) to light a candle, which directed her ſteps to that ſide of the bed ſhe conceived (by the ſound of his voice) he lay. Had you ſeen her advance her trembling limbs with the candle in her hand, and no other covert than her ſmock, you would have fancied her a Skeleton that had borrowed motion from the power of inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59287:18"/>

            <p>The Beauties of <hi>Lauretta</hi> had gain'd ſo intire a poſſeſſion of <hi>Francion</hi>'s heart, that though ſleep had made a ſeizure of this body, his active Spirits were agitated at this inſtant, with the thoughts of her in a dream ſo turbulent, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the proffer of three or four ill-ranged words, he ſtarted out of the bed.

            <p>The Gentleman (who waked at the noiſe the old Woman made to light her candle, though he would not ſpeak) fell into ſo violent a laughter, as made the bed ſhake under him. As for the old Woman, ſhe hugg'd

            <p>This ſaid, <hi>Agatha</hi> put her candle out, and returned to her own Bed, leaving them to reſt till morning, which arrived, they all began to riſe at once.

<q rend="inline margQuotes">You dote upon a malicious ill-condition'd woman (ſaid ſhe) I am ſure <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta</hi> would be no whit ſorry to ſee you drown'd, ſo ſhe had the cloathes: ſhe does nothing but for profit. That I have ſome reaſon to believe (replyed
<hi>Francion</hi>) for hearing me ſpeak of a faire Emerald I had, ſhe begg'd it of me, and after I promiſed to give it her, ſhe ſhewed me a kinder countenance than before. In the ſtory I heard you relate laſt night, I obſerved (continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Agatha</hi>) you ſaid a Maid made you fall from the top of a ladder to the ground; queſtionleſſe 'twas by her Miſtreſs command, ſhe gave you ſo rude a treatment, and perchance ſhe help'd her too, ſhe's baſe enough to act as unworthy things: Don't you perceive the impoſſibility ſhe pretended for you to ſee her Miſtreſſe was an abſolute lie? She could have given you more eaſie entrance into the Caſtle than by the window, but onely ſhe had a minde to ſet a greater price upon her favours by that imaginary difficulty. The bridge was drawn up (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) I could not get in any other way. She might have received you in the Caſtle in the day-time, and hid you in ſome private corner, replyed <hi>Agatha.</hi> That could not be contrived without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, anſwered <hi>Francion.</hi> I perceive you love her ſo well (continued <hi>Agatha</hi>) you cannot believe ſhe has any harm in her; you think all the vertues deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in one of her ſex, have ſo fortified themſelves in her ſoule, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her integrity, and hinder the approach of any vice.

            </p>
            <p>No ſooner had ſhe ſpoke theſe words, but the Gentleman bending his ſteps towards her, acknowledged the courteſie of her offer, and aſſured her he would be very glad to heare her ſtories, for they could not be diſagreeable: So, after a little pauſe, and ſaying ſhe ſhould give them an account of her own, as well as <hi>Lauretta</hi>'s actions, ſhe thus prepared their attention.</p>
            <p>I will not play the Hypocrite to you (Gallants) nor be nice in revealing my youthfull <hi>Amouretts,</hi> in regard I find you are not Doſſer-headed like divers others, and I know 'tis a glory for me to have followed the inſtinct of Mother Nature. You muſt take notice then, my Father, not being able to maintaine me alwaies at home, by reaſon of his great charge, and ſmall revenue, put me at fifteen yeares of age, to ſerve a Gentlewoman in <hi>Paris,</hi> whoſe husband had ſome office towards the Law: In faith ſhe was the wicked'ſt woman I ever ſaw; oh Heavens! how will you believe it? He that needed her, had been better he had be wedg'd to a Gibbet, or chain'd to a ſeat in a Gallie, than link'd to her in the bonds of Matrimony, his ſufferance would not have been half ſo great: As ſoon as e're ſhe could get ready in a morning, ſhe preſently went to play; &amp; frolickt with her neighbour Goſſips. If my Maſter came in late from the Hall, 'twas to ſmall purpoſe to complain of emptineſs and hunger, ſhe never took care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide any thing for his dinner; for, becauſe her ſtomack was cramm'd with junkets and good drink, ſhe thought others were as full as ſhe. Beſides, if he began to give his tongue the liberty to expreſs his diſlike, he was forc'd to cloſe his mouth again immediatly, for fear of irritating her fury more; Elſe ſhe would ſtun's ears with ſuch inceſſant rayling, as he muſt have put on the armour of
<hi>Job</hi>'s patience to endure it. Though 'twas the multiplicity of his occaſions often hindered him from coming home betimes, ſhee'd ſcould, and ſay his drunken companions had made him ſtay bowzing in ſome ſcurvy
<hi>Cabaret.</hi> This would make him take his Cloak and goe dine abroad, but that made his cauſe ſtill worſe; for ſhe uſed ſo to contrive the buſineſſe, that ſome of her Goſsips ſhould ſend ſome unſuſpected meſſenger to watch whither he went, and then ſhe would begin to rante in theſe termes: <hi>You ſee my houſe is deteſtable to him, he never cares to come in't, neither to Bed nor Board</hi> &amp; ſo continu'd her clamours till ſome of her friends reprov'd her.</p>
            <p>I give you leave to judge, if I had not a pleaſant time in her ſervice; Heaven knows how often ſhe has made me ſup <hi>by roat,</hi> when ſhe had bin feaſting all day among her fellow-Bibbers, &amp; how many thumps and pinches ſhe has given me, eſpecially if I ſet but a pin awry in her dreſs; and many times with a needle ſhe us'd to hold in hand, ſhe would goad my armes when I leaſt ſuſpected danger. Once the Kitchin-maid being out of the way at dinner-time, I was commanded to make an
<hi>Aumelet,</hi> it being Friday, but becauſe I had put in one bad Eg, and ſome tallow fell by chance into the pan, my M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>, clapp'd it like a mask all over my face. If I had not pleas'd her at any time in my work, when any of her Goſſips came to viſit her, I was the only ſubject of their diſcourſe. <hi>My maid</hi> (ſaies ſhe) <hi>does this, &amp; ſhe does that, as I am an honeſt woman ſhe's almoſt a perfect Devil, ſhe wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it but the horns. Mine</hi> (anſwer'd another of the Goſſips)
<hi>exceeds her in wickedneſs, Ile tell you ſome of her tricks:</hi> Then ſhe began to reckon up her Maids faults, among others, ſhe ſaid,
<hi>whereas</hi> a Veſſel of wine uſed to laſt 3. Months, it would not hold out two ſince that wench had the key of the Cellar; that having a ſhrewd ſuſpition ſhe uſed to drink out of the Pot every time ſhe went to draw Wine, to be aſcertain'd of her doubt, ſhe ſmear'd the inner ring of the pot-lid with ink, ſo the wench returned with a black creſſant on her forehead, which diſcovered what ſhe had formerly denied: If ſhe were ſent of an errand, ſhe was ſo full of chat, as a whole dayes time was little enough for her to finde <pb n="27" facs="tcp:59287:20"/>the way home againe, eſpecially if ſhe met with any idle fellowes that would hold her in diſcourſe of Love. This was our Miſtreſſes converſation when they met.</p>
            <p>But Ile aſſure you, when chance conducted me into the company of that Maid, her Miſtreſs had ſo blazon'd, I wanted neither Tongue nor Memory to repeat her every Particular. Then we took our turns to prattle, having the opportunity to condole each other's misfortunes, and we ripped up our Madams faults as faſt as they had ours: Oh! 'tis a Soveraign Pleaſure to ſpeak ill of thoſe have given the offence; and you may think we were not ſparing of our tongues.</p>
            <p>Now I muſt tell you how, and wherefore I left that ſervice: My Miſtreſs was very ſumptuous in her rayment, and her greateſt contentment conſiſted in being gallanter than her Neighbours; ſo that if ſhe ſaw any one with a new Gown, or other toy <hi>alamode,</hi> ſhe was mad to have the like; this reduced her to comportments extreamly contrary to her diſpoſition; for ſhe was forc'd to fawn and careſs her husband with extraordinary ſubmiſſions to draw the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row out of his Purſe.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">Ah my Dear! my Minion (would ſhe ſay, ſmothering him almoſt with throngs of kiſſes) Wilt thou alwaies endure that little Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers brat at the corner of our ſtreet, who was taken not long ſince lowſing under a hedge, ſhould out-brave and ſcoff at me every time ſhe meets me, as if I were nothing in compariſon of her, becauſe ſhe has a finer Gown than I?

            <p>This was the diſcourſe ſhe made her Husband in her neceſſities, and having learned the trick to ſweeten him, and lull his minde aſleep with pleaſing Daliances, promiſing to recompence his liberality with an obedient ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance for the future, ſometimes ſhe obtain'd what ever ſhe deſired of him.</p>
            <p>One day, her vanity preſſing her to deſire a Neck-lace of bigger Pearles than thoſe ſhe had, ſhe reſolved to make recourſe to her ordinary flatteries; but ſomething had put my Maſter in ſo froward a humour, that he repuls'd her with ſuch terms as ſhe deſerv'd: finding faire language would prevail nothing with him, ſhe flew into another extremity, and began to revile him in the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt and bittereſt manner her fury could invent: She reproached him with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, telling him, had it not been for her, he might be glad to be received in a Hoſpitall, that the fortune ſhe brought had raiſed him from the Dunghil, and yet he refuſed to give her a petty ſumme of money to buy her neceſſarries: She called him Sonne of a Peaſant, and ſaid he was fitter to work day-work in the Vineyards (as he was bred to while he was young) than to be her Husband. This touch'd him to the quick, and to revenge himſelf, ſomewhat he reply'd, The plain Country people, without fraud and malice, were every whit as good as ſuch cheating Merchants as her Father was: Then he began to ſumme up the knaveries, uſuries and extortions of her Progenitors. Hereat her rage was ſo increaſed, that, ſetting her arms a-kemboll, and darting fire from her eyes, <hi>How now Villaine (ſaid ſhe) art thou then ſo audacious, as to ſpeake ill of him, who took ſo much pains to purchaſe the eſtate thou now enjoyeſt? Ha! by S.</hi> Barbara, <hi>Merchants are a thouſand times more eſtimable than ſuch raſcally Proctors as thou art. Thou makeſt thy boaſts among thy Pot-companions, that by thy induſtry, thou haſt got the greateſt part of the Eſtate thou now poſſeſſeſt; but thou lieſt (falſe <pb n="28" facs="tcp:59287:21"/>Traitor) all came from my deare Father, whoſe ſoule is now in glory: Alas (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, with a ſhowre of teares, and many intermittent ſobbs) he never commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo grand an errour, as that of giving me in marriage with ſuch a Jew as thou art.</hi> Then having given her heart a little eaſe by the vent of her eyes, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reproach his profeſſion, telling him if he had added any thing to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſhe brought him, it was but by couſening and ſcrewing up his Clients; from theſe Generalls ſhe deſcended to the repetition of his particular Crimes in ſuch open tearms, as had he been in the humour to have gone preſently to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, he needed no better Directory, than her tongue to inſtruct him what he had to accuſe himſelf of before the Prieſt.</p>
            <p>This was a good conveniencie: and it was but beating her upon any great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydaies-Eve (if he deſired to recall to his memory any paſt offences) and it would ſave him the labour of peruſing the <hi>Miroic</hi> of Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>By chance a Country-fellow being in the Office with his Clerk, heard (among other things) my Miſtreſſe charge her Husband with cheating that poore man not long before, making him pay ſix Crownes for expedition of a buſineſſe that was not worth one. Intereſt adding Boldneſſe to his Ruſticity, the Swaine ſtept chafing into the roome where the diſpute was held, and with much clamour, <hi>You Maſter Proctor</hi> (ſaid he)
<hi>Reſtore me the five Crownes you took of me th'other day more than was your due, Ile appeale to your Wifes teſtimony if I have not reaſon to demand it.</hi> My Maſter having his mind ſufficiently perplext already, returned him no anſwer; This ſilence made the Clowne cry louder; meane time my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe held her peace, having almoſt rent her throat with brawling; and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to decide their owne difference, ſhe flung out of the houſe, with ſo much fury in her face, as her looks would have frighted any that fixt their eyes upon her. I, whoſe office it was to follow her like a ſhadow when ere ſhe went abroad, failed not of my duty at that time, but waited on her to a Kinſmans houſe of hers, where ſhe took full liberty to inveigh againſt the baſeneſſe and avarice of her husband; and concluded her railing with a Vow ſhe would be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced from him. This Kinſman, who underſtood the querks and malices of Law, ingaged to commence and proſecute the Sute. At length, becauſe ſhe was a friend to him that ſate at that time Judge in all ſuch Cauſes, (of whom Ile ſay no more, than that he was as honeſt a man as ſome others of his Cloth) ſhe obtain'd a Writ of Separation.</p>
            <p>The Sentence paſſed thus in her favour, ſhe continued ſtill in the houſe where ſhe firſt retired, and received frequent Viſits of ſeverall ſpruce young Gallants: Among the reſt, one of a very gentile and winning garbe, (after lending me cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine amorous looks in my Miſtreſſes chamber, that diſpleaſed me not) as I wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on him downe with a Candle, offered to kiſſe me upon the ſtaires; but I thruſt him ſo rudely back, as I perceived much diſ-ſatisfaction in his countenance at my coyneſſe. A few dayes after he return'd, and in recompence of his former fault, he handſomely convey'd into my hand ſome <hi>Quardecu's,</hi> which rendred me as pliant and ſupple as a Spaniſh Glove; not that I was ready to accord him the leaſt favour in the world; I mean onely, I felt ſomething plead an intereſt for him in my inclinations.</p>
            <p>I never could have thought he affected me ſo much, as afterwards I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved he did, if a ſtrange woman I met by chance at the Hall, had not aſſured me of his love, telling me, I had then the opportunity of making my ſelfe the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt Woman breathing, if I would but leave my Miſtreſs and go dwell with him. This was enough to make me ſpread my Plumes, and conceit my ſelfe much handſomer than my Miſtreſs, ſince one of her own Pigeons left her Dove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat to come to mine. And in effect, I remember ſhe was ſo jealous of me, while I lived with her husband, that one time ſhe refuſed to take her recreation in the Countrey, leſt in her abſence he ſhould have made me lie in the high Bed.</p>

<hi>Monſieur de la Fontaine</hi>'s Man having entered into my favour by little and little, gain'd a greater ſhare in my affections than his Maſter, in regard the equality of our conditions permitted me to ſpeak more familiarly to him and in fine, I divided my heart no longer in two parts, but gave him intire poſſeſſion of the whole.</p>
            <p>I had ſome inkling, that my Maſter, perſwaded by his friends to leave that courſe of life, was upon termes of Marriage.

Next morning my Maſter feeling in his Cup-board, and not finding what he left there, he thunder'd moſt terribly about the houſe, and at laſt underſtanding his Man had been abſent ever ſince the night before, he had no ſuſpition of any body elſe but him: For my part I conceived <hi>Marſault,</hi> not daring to returne home, ſtayed ſomewhere thereabouts expecting my comming: But 'twas impoſſible for me to follow him ſo quickly; for, then I had quitted the reſolution of going away without my Maſters leave; However I indeavour'd to haſten my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to that purpoſe one day I told him, I heard he was upon the point of Marriage, which effected I could not remaine any longer in his houſe.</p>
            <p>After a little faint denyall he conſented to my leaving him, and I believe he was glad I made the firſt Motion. Both parties agreed, I went one night to digg up my treaſure, and next morning fairely took my leave. With what my Maſter gave me, and I had purchaſed by my own induſtry, I thought my ſelf exceeding rich, and my <hi>Rendez-vous</hi> was at
<hi>Perretta</hi>'s houſe, where I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with much joy and courteſie. When ſhe underſtood what money I had, ſhe counſell'd me to make uſe of that, as a bait to draw in more ſuch Cuſtomers, and made me put my ſelf in the habit of a <hi>'Damoiſelle,</hi> which (ſhe ſaid) made me look like a little Nymph of the Woods. Oh Heavens! how glad was I to ſee my ſelf trick'd up in ſuch gay rayments, and have alwayes ſome young gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants addreſsing their courtſhip to me, as if I had been ſome Lady of high quality: But the preſents I received were not of ſuch Value as to defray our Charges, which were great as well for Diet as Houſe-rent; Beſides <hi>Perretta</hi> would have the happineſſe (as well as I) to play the Gentlewoman a little before her death: So that in ſhort time I ſaw the end of my Gold, and had nothing to live on but my bare induſtry.</p>
            <p>One evening <hi>Perretta</hi> condoling with me the Calamities of the Times, we heard a buſtling in the ſtreet: Her curioſity carried her to the Doore to ſee what the matter was. But ſhe admired, when a man running as faſt as his legs could beare him, put into her hands a Velvet Cloak lined through with a rich Pluſh, without ſpeaking a word to her; I thought it was becauſe he knew her, for her fame was ſufficiently ſpread about the City, and in all the Academies of <hi>Love</hi> ſhe was the Lamp that gave light to all Women of her vocation.</p>
            <p>The Pawne ſhe had received thus by chance was extreamly welcome, and we fell preſently to ripping it by Candle-light, leſt it ſhould be knowne when we carried it to the <hi>Frippery:</hi> We hop'd the money we ſhould get for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, would, beſides relieving our preſent neceſſities, furniſh us with an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtock to maintain us till more came: But next day, as we ſate talking with an honeſt man, that often uſed to viſite us, we heard one knock below; the Maid had no ſonner open'd the doore, but in ruſh'd three ſturdy Souldiers, and asked for the Miſtreſſe of the houſe: She hearing them inquire for her, went down to know their buſineſs; one of them preſently ſtepping to her, ſaid,
<hi>Pray reſtore me the Cloak I delivered you laſt night, as I paſſed by this way. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta</hi> not willing to part with ſuch a prey, denyed ſhe ever received any Cloak of him, and ſaid ſhe knew him not ſo well to take any thing from his hands to keep. This made them word it high, and raiſe ſuch a Tintamarre, as invited me to deſcend to know the cauſe of that diſorder; but coming into the entry, I preſently knew one of the three demanded the Cloak, was my former friend <hi>Marſault;</hi> ſtartled, and in ſome confuſion at the ſight of him, I retreated and hid my ſelf, fearing to be diſcovered by him. Mean time, the conteſtation grew
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59287:23"/>ſo hot, as the chief Officer of that ward, receiving notice of the difference, came thither with his guard, not ſo much to decide the quarrell, as to get his ſhare of the Booty. Obſerve but this paſſage a little, and how juſt this Man of Juſtice was. Thoſe that contended with <hi>Perretta</hi> were Thieves, and he knew them to be no better, yet he ſtuck not to affirme the Cloak, they had ſtollen, belonged to them, as if it had been a Prize taken from an Enemy, and condemned
<hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta</hi> to reſtore it them: So ſhe (knowing the power of that officer in thoſe parts, and how much it concerned her to gain his good opinion) would not provoke his indignation by appealing from his ſentence; but confeſſing ſhe had, indeed, received a Cloak, ſhe declared (to avoid further diſpute) ſhe was willing to render ſuch ſatisfaction for it, as he ſhould ordain, though of the Cloak it ſelf it was impoſſible for her to make reſtitution, having already ſold it; and if he, and the three Souldiers (who laid claim to it) would accept of an entertainment at her houſe, they ſhould be very welcom, and ſee the ſpending of all the money it yeilded her.</p>
            <p>Small invitation ſerved their turn, they conſented to the firſt motion, and were ready, without further delay, to accept the offer: The Maid was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent to all places likely to furniſh, in a moment, wherewith to cover a table: Mean time, when I ſaw <hi>Marſault</hi> come into the Room where I was, I chang'd my colour in one inſtant, oftner than a Cameleon could do all his life, and for my further miſchief, he, that ſate talking with me, went away, ſo I was inforc'd to entertain thoſe that ſtaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marſault</hi> regarded me with attentive eyes, and obſerv'd my actions and tone with an aſtoniſhment not ordinary; For he began to harbour a conceit I was the ſame <hi>Agatha,</hi> with whom he had formerly contracted ſo familiar an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but my change of habit made him diſtruſt his judgment At our meal there was no ſpare of Liquor, &amp; our Gueſts, drunk into kinder humors, acknowledged themſelves fully ſatisfied of <hi>Perretta,</hi> &amp;, becauſe our Profeſſions had need of each others ſupport, we tyed our ſelves by mutuall Oaths, to preſerve an inviolable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and favourable aſſiſtance to eternity. This done, they retir'd to their own habitations, and next day <hi>Marſault</hi> fail'd not to return with five of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, in better equipage than thoſe I had ſeen the day before: After ſome diſcourſe of indifferent ſubjects, taking me a little aſide, <hi>'Tis but in vaine</hi> (ſaid he)
<hi>for you to indeavour to conceale your ſelfe, I know you well enough.</hi> To which I preſently replyed, It never was my intent to keep any thing ſecret from his knowledge, and he muſt excuſe me, if the precedent day I made him no adreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, nor diſcovered him my condition, in regard I thought it not ſo convenient, becauſe of the other perſons then preſent. Satisfied with this Reply, he began to examine me what I had done with our Maſters mony: I ſuſpecting he would urge that queſtion whenſoever he found opportunity, had prepared confidence enough to make him believe <hi>Monſieur de la Fontaine,</hi> after much ſearch, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it in my Coffer, had taken it againe from me, and afterwards turn'd me out of doores: As for my preſent condition, it required no admiration, for he might eaſily gueſs how I put my ſelf into that gallant garb, and which way I maintained it.</p>
            <p>Thus in an inſtant were we reconcil'd, and the knot of our friendſhip being made faſter now than ever, by the renewing of our mutuall embraces, he took his turn to ſpeak; and giving me a particular account how he came to <hi>Paris,</hi> and what manner of life he had choſen; He told me, being no longer able to ſtoop and ſubject his ſpirit to the ſtern commands of ſevere Maſters, he met with a gallant man of his own Country (one of thoſe I ſaw) who had inſtructed him to ſeek (as he did himſelf) occaſions of adventures night and day, and robb all they could: and in further vindication of his profeſſion, he aſſured me, there were great numbers of Blades in <hi>Paris,</hi> that lived by no other trade, and had ſeverall marks among themſelves, that diſtinguiſh'd them from others: as to <pb n="33" facs="tcp:59287:23"/>weare all red Cloaks, low Collars, their Hats truſs'd up on one ſide, and a plume of Feathers on the other, whence (and not improperly) the Vulgar impoſed upon that Fraternity the name of
<hi>Plumers.</hi> Their exerciſe by day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, was to wander about the ſtreets, and create quarrells upon nothing, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to try if they could handſomely twich a Cloak among the confuſed mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: In the night they had other different wayes of keeping their hands in practiſe Some of them had the induſtry to inſinuate themſelves into compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, inticing thoſe they met to ingage in play with them, and then win their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by new invented Cheats; and they had the Policie to keep ſo faire a Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with the Miniſters of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> as they very ſeldome under-went any diſgrace or puniſhment, unleſſe they encountred ſome powerfull Adverſary that had his Purſe better lined than theirs. In ſumme, after he had acquainted me with the chiefeſt ſecrets of their conſortſhip, I took the liberty to ask him if none of them apprehended hanging:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">Scarce any of us (anſwered he) ever ſuffer ſuch a thought to harbour in our minds, we fear not to aſſiſt oft-times at the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of ſome of our own Camarades; for, nothing dazles our eyes, nothing is capable of moving our hearts, ſo much as the ſacred thirſt of Gold, nor are our conſiderations bent to any thing but ſeeking wherewithal to ſpend our dayes in delight;</q> If any of them chanc'd to be made dance ith' rope, they thought him happy to be ſo freed of the care and trouble attends the miſerable indigent.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">We are for the moſt part (continued he) Servants of all ſorts of qualities, that will ſerve no longer; And beſides, among us there are divers tradeſ-mens Sons of the City, who not willing to contein themſelves within the narrow bounds of their Father's mean conditions, have made themſelves Brothers of the <hi>Blade,</hi> thinking the repute and garb of Sword-men, would conduce much to their Gentility; and after the expence of what they had in poſſeſſion, and their Parents deniall of further ſubſiſtence, uſed meanes to be admitted into our Society: Nay, I will tell you more (and what your Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment perchance will hardly give you leave to credit) there are ſome Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of ſo high quality, as (for reſpect to their dignities) I ſhall forbeare to name them, who delighting in our courſe of life, diſdame not oft-times to keep us company, and uſe our Nocturnall exerciſe, onely with this difference, We diſ-mantle all ſorts of People, Fortune directs into our hands, and they ſcorn to attaque any but perſons of quality, eſpecially ſuch as ſeem able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and bear the marks of Courage in their countenance, purpoſely to make trial of their skill at Arms and Valour. Yet they do take Cloaks too, and glory in having gotten ſuch a purchaſe at the point of their ſwords; for which gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, they are called <hi>Silk-ſnatchers,</hi> whereas we (who lurk in Corners, and prey upon all Paſſengers without diſtinction) have the generall appellation of <hi>Cloak-twichers.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Marſault</hi> had aſſured me of the truth of this Relation, I admired the Brutality and Baſeneſſe of thoſe Noble-mens ſoules (unworthy of the Dignity and Rank they held at Court) who patroniz'd that <hi>Vice,</hi> by cloathing it with the Livery of a remarkable
<hi>Vertue.</hi> The <hi>Plumers</hi> and <hi>Filous,</hi> methinks, were not ſo blameable, in regard their End was onely to preſerve themſelves from Want; they were not ſo vain nor fooliſh to cry up unwarrantable victory, gained over perſons aſſaulted unawares.</p>
            <p>In ſumme, <hi>Perretta</hi> having gained their acquaintance, became their Receiver, and concealed the Goods they ſtole, retaining a part to her ſelfe, which ſerved to maintaine us. The Commiſſary of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter connived at this correſpondence, though the Neigbours importuned him without ceaſe to unneaſt us, for, the ſhare we allowed him of our profits, was not ſo inconſiderable, but it contributed much to the warming of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>During this intelligence, we played a number of admirable Cheats, ſtill <pb n="34" facs="tcp:59287:24"/>ſqueezing one or others purſe (maugre all reſiſtance) to pay the exceſſive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of our continuall diſorders: I ſhall onely trouble you with the relation of one, which (I dare ſay) you will not grudge the time to hear. The deſigne had its ſource and conduct from the Invention of <hi>Marſault,</hi> whoſe Practiſe had rendred him one of the ſubtileſt and moſt exquiſite
<hi>Rogues,</hi> among the <hi>Bandes</hi> of <hi>Rougets</hi> and
<hi>Griſens,</hi> ſo the Companies of his Profeſſion, for diſtinction, ſtyled themſelves. He continued making uſe of me as oft as deſire invited him, and was not Jealous though others injoyed the ſame Priviledge, ſo it brought him in Profit, and none the Promoter of their Pleaſures but himſelfe. From all parts of <hi>Paris</hi> he procured me Cuſtomers, and none of the meaneſt ſort, he ſcorn'd to faſten his fancy upon common Preyes; His ayme was alwayes at the faireſt Marks, and to bring me into the moſt beneficiall Practice; as you ſhall ſee by the ſequele of this Narration.</p>
            <p>Chance conducting <hi>Marſault</hi> to take a lodging in the ſuburbs of St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> where a young Engliſh Gentleman had entred himſelfe in Penſion; after ſome handſome inſinuations as Prologues to their acquaintance, the ſtranger took occaſion to ſay, he ſaw no ſuch beautifull Women in <hi>France</hi> as in his Country.
<hi>Marſault,</hi> deſiring no better than to finde his inclinations that way bent, cunningly replyed, <hi>They hide themſelves at</hi> Paris <hi>in their owne houſes, like Treaſures of high value, that are not to be expoſed to every vulgar view.</hi> This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer giving the young Gentleman confidence enough to ask if he knew any of thoſe eminent Beauties: <hi>Ile ſhew you the handſomeſt my eyes ever yet beheld (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued</hi> Marſault) <hi>but ſhe's maintained by one of the greateſt Noble-men of the Court.</hi> This ſaid, he invited him to take a walk, telling him by the way, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Mervails of my Perfections, and at laſt bringing him through our ſtreet, he ſhewed him where I dwelt. The Plot was ſo contriv'd, that he was forced to make at leaſt ten or twelve ſeverall journeys before he could ſee me at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, (for I looked not often out) and when I did appeare, I choſe the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Evening; ſo that the poor Engliſh man, already pre-poſſeſſed with an opinion of tranſcendent Beauties, and not able, at that diſtance, to diſcover by twy-light, the defects of my face (if it then had any) believed me the perfecteſt of all <hi>Nature</hi>'s handy-works. <hi>Marſault</hi> perceiving the Fiſh begin to bite, as they returned home, <hi>This Lady and I</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>are not ſo unacquainted, but that ſhe acknowledges me her kinſman, where ever I chance to ſee her.</hi> This preſently bred a curioſity in the Stranger, to ask him if he went not ſometimes to viſit me, and if he might not have the favour to accompany him to my lodging <hi>How Sir</hi> (<hi>replyed</hi> Marſault) <hi>I can ſcarce obtain that Priviledge for my ſelfe; for the Noble-man, whoſe Miſtreſſe ſhe is, though he loves her as his ſoule, is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding jealous, as the leaſt action ſhe does, is obſerved by the Spies he has over her, which hinder her from converſing with any bodie, eſpecially in private: Beſides, if you harbour any hopes of purchaſing a place in her affections, I believe you'l not finde it ſo ſenſible as you imagine, though your merit (I muſt confeſſe) is infinite; for, ſhe has already lodged her heart too well, ſo ſodainely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This difficulty added fewell to the fire, and rendered my young Gallant more importunate; No day paſſed but he went the <hi>Round</hi> about my houſe, as if he came to view the Walls, and take it by aſſault. At laſt, after ſome inſtructions how to play my game, as my new Amoriſt walked gazing towards my window. I ſtill would finde ſome occaſion to be peeping out, and anſwer his looks with ſuch languiſhing glances, as if I had been ready to reſign my <hi>Life</hi> to <hi>Love.</hi> One day
<hi>Marſault</hi> ſtaid on purpoſe to diſcourſe with me at the door, knowing his Camarade was not farre off, and as he paſſed, <hi>Pray who is that Stanger?</hi> (ſaid I aloud) <hi>He is a very compleat Gentleman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This word (which he o're-heard conveyed its pleaſing poyſon through his Eares into his Heart; yet his paſſion was nothing in compariſon of thoſe <pb n="35" facs="tcp:59287:24"/>flames he felt torment his breaſt, when <hi>Marſault</hi> being returned to his lodging) told him I inquired more particularly of him after he was gone by, <hi>that</hi> I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſuch contentment in ſeeing him, as I alwayes took occaſion to ſtand at Window about the houre I had obſerv'd him walk that way.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">This is a faire beginning for your love (continued he) perſiſt at all adventures, I'me confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent I can contribute ſomething to the advancement of your Intereſts.</q> My Engliſh man, drunk with contentment, knew no other way to expreſſe his joy and thankfulneſſe at preſent, but by often iterating his embraces and careſſes to <hi>Marſault;</hi> who, to begin to feather his Neſt, deſired his Hoſt to give out, he owed him fifty Crowns for Diet and Lodging: This fellow (the Hoſt) kept a <hi>Cabaret,</hi> and went a ſhare with the <hi>Filous,</hi> when they inticed their <hi>Gulls</hi> in there to drink, and be cheated of their money at play, or forced to part with it upon harder terms; ſo there needed no great intreaty to make him grant ſuch a requeſt to one of his own Society. All thus agreed, as <hi>Marſault</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with the Engliſh-man, the Hoſt, with a feigned ſeverity, came and told him, he had preſent occaſion for the fifty crowns he owed him, and he muſt, and ſhould pay him: <hi>Marſault</hi> replied, he had money enough to diſcharge ten times ſuch a debt, but could not command it at preſent; with this the Hoſt fell a vapouring and ſwearing, he would be fool'd no longer, he ſhould pay him his money, or he would fetch thoſe ſhould lay him faſt enough. When he was gone out of the Room,
<hi>Marſault</hi> pretending to be afraid he ſhould bring Serjeants to affront him, deſired the Engliſh-man to aſſiſt him in that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and without much difficulty, obtain'd the full ſumme he demanded, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing in very ſhort time to return it, and threatning to be revenged of his Landlord for reducing him to ſuch an exigence: But, in conſideration of the grand favour he acknowledged from his courteſie (after contenting that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civill fellow's greedineſſe) he ſaid he would make a ſtep to my houſe to ſound me once again, if my heart might not be rendred ſenſible of any other flames be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his, whom he knew I loved already.</p>
            <p>At his return, he made the poor Foole believe, he had ſo prepared the way for him to my minde, as he ſhould finde me intirely diſpoſed to contract a perfect Amity with him, aſſuring him I deſired nothing more than the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his converſation. Then he told him, he would do himſelf much right, and advance the atchievement of his deſires, if he ſent me ſome pretty Preſent, as a Diamond bodkin to put in my haire, which he had obſerved I wanted; for (ſaid he) Women in this country are of a craving diſpoſition, and inclinable to love thoſe beſt that ſpend moſt, &amp; charm them with the greateſt gifts. This paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Stranger went preſently to buy what <hi>Marſault</hi> bad him, and intruſted it in his hands to bring me, with promiſe he ſhould ſee me wear it, when he found convenience to conduct him into my preſence.

            <p>I never had better ſport than at the ſimple eagerneſſe of this fond forrainer, and receiving notice next day what time he was to viſite me, I waited his coming at the door, where he accoſted me with ſuch over-action in his complements, as it was no eaſie task for me to keep my countenance. He underſtood not French <pb n="36" facs="tcp:59287:25"/>very well, not I his Fuſtian Language; ſo our diſcourſe was a perpetuall
<hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe:</hi> When he made me tenders of his affection, I thought he had reproached me the rich Preſent he had ſent me, Yet I was not ready to return it him: When I applauded his Merits, he anſwered me, if <hi>Paris</hi> had afforded a fairer Diamond than that he ſent me, it ſhould have been at my ſervice.</p>
            <p>At length <hi>Marſault</hi> taking upon him the office of
<hi>Trucheman,</hi> ſaved us both a labour, and made us better underſtand each others meaning, telling me in two words, <hi>That gallant Gentleman I ſaw, was ready to die with Love for me:</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had replyed, he told the Stranger, Above all vices in the world I abhorred the ſin of Ingratitude, and ſhould be ready to anſwer his affection, ſince it was accompanied with ſuch incomparable ornaments of Nature, and inward Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as had rendered my Soul his Captive.</p>
            <p>Juſt at the cloſe of this Diſcourſe, <hi>Perretta</hi> coming out of her Chamber, ſaid in an angry tone, as if ſhe had been offended at my ſtay, <hi>Come hither, who doe you ſpeak with there below?</hi> I am talking with my Couſin (anſwerd I:) then in a dejected manner, that betrayed ſome fear, I preſently bade adieu to my reall Servant, and feined Kinſman, who (after their departure) failed not to tell this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriſt, ſhe whom he heard begin to chide, was an old Woman the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had hired on purpoſe to guard me, and if he pretended ever to make a Conqueſt of ſo precious a Treaſure as my Beauty, he muſt indeavour to charm that ſleepleſs Dragon, which he thought not impoſſible, if he blinded her with ſome Crowns of Gold. The Bands of his Affection were ſo firmly tyed, that he eaſily conſented to looſen thoſe of his purſe: So the next day returning with <hi>Marſault,</hi> and finding
<hi>Perretta</hi> at the door, ſhe had no ſooner declared by way of diſcourſe, that ſhe was much ſtraitned for want of money, and knew not on a ſodaine where to borrow any, but he offered to bring her preſently as much as her occaſions did require; and in effect, returning inſtantly to his lodging, fetch'h her an hundred Livres, which was about the ſumme ſhe told <hi>Marſault</hi> ſhe wanted. After he had counted it to her in her Chamber, he whiſper'd <hi>Marſault</hi> in the ear, and bade him remember his buſineſſe; and he having diſcourſed a while in private with
<hi>Perretta,</hi> returned him this pleaſing anſwer, that overcome by his courteſie, ſhe was reſolved to faile in the fidelity ſhe had promiſed to a great Noble-man to comply with his deſires, and give him the opportunity of enjoying me, if his paſſion could diſpenſe but with ſo many houres delay as the Sun required to compleat his next dayes courſe.</p>
            <p>The time for this amorous appointment being expired, my Lover came to our houſe, <hi>attired</hi> (I think I might ſay <hi>tired</hi>) with a ſuit covered all over with very rich Gold lace: For, though the <hi>King</hi> had forbid his ſubjects thoſe ſuperfluities, he, who was a ſtranger took pleaſure in ſuch Gayes, on purpoſe to be the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by wearing Cloathes out of the Common <hi>Mode.</hi> All his body was moſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſpunged and bath'd in perfumed waters; for, imagining he was to lye with the Miſtreſſe of a <hi>Grandee,</hi> accuſtomed to the ſumptuous treats of high perſons, he thought he muſt not accoſt her in any meaner way, leſt he ſhould be deſpiſed. When we were together in the Bed, I muſt confeſſe I did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Precept <hi>Perretta</hi> and
<hi>Marſault</hi> gave me, which was not to impart the ſift and laſt favour of <hi>Love,</hi> nor ſuffer my Amoriſt to exceed the Priviledge of theſe foure Preparatives, <hi>Seeing, Speaking, Kiſſing</hi> and
<hi>Feeling:</hi> For (why ſhould I diſſemble?) I conſider'd not ſo much the profit they aſſur'd me I ſhould reap, by counterfeiting a nice unwillingneſs, as the pleaſure I then felt, tickling and provoking my appetite to the free injoyment of thoſe Delights the heat of <hi>Love</hi> communicates in ſuch encounters. Beſide, the curioſity I had to try if there were more contentment with a Forreiner than a Frenchman; this Gentleman was ſo fair, ſo ſweet, and had ſo delicate a skin, that (in faith) I muſt have been leſs humane than a Tygreſs, to refuſe making his
<hi>Needle</hi> touch the <hi>Pole</hi> its point ſtood towards, with ſo much vigorous ſympathie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:59287:25"/>Our Commiſſary, who had quickly notice of this new Purchaſe, came to have a Gleaning of our Harveſt, while we were in the cloſeſt embraces you can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; <hi>Perretta</hi> op'd him gently the doore, with admonition to play his part diſcreetly. At his arrivall I roſe, haſtily conveying my ſelfe in my ſmock, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the bed and wall, and my Lover diſtracted at this ſurpriſe, hearing him ſay, <hi>To Priſon with her,</hi> ran preſently to his ſword, but was hindred from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any execution by a Serjeant and his Aſſiſtant, who furiouſly ſeized his Arme, threatning to provide him a lodging at the Kings charge. After a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of fruitleſs ſupplications he conſidered his beſt way was to make uſe of that divine Metall the whole world is inchanted with, and lightening his pockets of ſome Crowns of Gold, he ſtopped the mouths of thoſe greedy Curres ſo well, as they ſoon gave over barking, and left us in full liberty to renew our ſports in Bed.</p>
            <p>This was the firſt Alarm, but not the laſt nor the moſt dangerous; for as theſe Raſcalls ſpirits were revived, and the fear diſperſed (which had almoſt congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their Bloud, and rendered them as ſtupid, as if they had been ſtunn'd with the ſodain ſtroke of Death) being ready to make themſelves merry with his money, one knocked like a Perſon of Authority at the doore; which preſently unbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, up comes one of <hi>Marſault</hi>'s Companions, clad like a Lord indeed, into my Chamber, with three others at his heeles, who by their reſpects and diſtance, ſeemed to be his Servants: I, who was acquainted with their Mummerie, made my Bed-felow believe this was the Noble-man maintained me, and deſired him to hide himſelf behind the Hangings. This vapouring <hi>Cloak-twicher,</hi> who perſonated the <hi>Grandee</hi> to the life, proudly asked <hi>Perretta</hi> where I was: <hi>She's already in bed</hi> (anſwered ſhe) <hi>for we expected not your coming this night; beſides, ſhe has a paine in her head that indispoſes her very much Came not my little Page hither this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, to tell you I would not fail to viſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t her? replied the</hi> Brave, <hi>We ſee him not, ſaid</hi> Perretta. <hi>What a young Rogue's this (continued he) I ſhall teach him to doe what I command, He's trifling away his time at play ſomewhere among his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: I thought to have bin here ſooner, but after waiting on the K. at ſupper, I was conſtrained by his Majeſtie's particular command, to retire into the private cloſet with him, to receive the honour he was pleaſed to doe me, by the communication of ſome of his moſt ſecret intentions: I came but immediately from thence, and becauſe I would not go home to my own houſe, I have commanded my ſervants to bring my ſupper hither.</hi> This ſaid, one of his Attendants covered the table, while the reſt brought in ſeverall diſhes of meat.</p>
            <p>My Lord was no ſooner ſet, but fell to work with his Chops, and after drinking a glaſs of wine, and wiping his Muſtachoes with a notable affected gravity, <hi>Agatha my pretty Miſtreſs (ſaid he to me aloud are you aſleep? Shall we have no Love-toys to night?</hi> At theſe words, as if I had awaked out of a ſound ſleep, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the curtain a little aſide (I anſwered, rubbing my eyes) I would do what he pleaſed.
<hi>You muſt riſe then for a while, and eat a bit</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Perretta <hi>to me</hi>) <hi>I am ſure you have not ſupp'd, and I believe your diſeaſe conſiſts onely in opinion: It is no matter whether the Diſeaſe, indiſpoſed me a while ſince, were imaginary or not (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed I) ſince now I feel my ſelf abſolutely cured:</hi> So putting on an under Petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat, and my Mantle about my ſhoulders, I ſtept out at the farther ſide of the Bed, and came round about to pay my obeyſance to this brave Lord. After ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me, <hi>You had ſomebody (ſaid he) behinde the Bed to help dreſſe you, or I am miſtaken, yet I ſee no body come forth after you. Be pleaſed to pardon me (anſwered I) there's no creature living; but I am ſure I heard a coughing not like yours, &amp; really (continu'd he, riſing from the table) I muſt know who it is:</hi> Steward <hi>bring the candle here.</hi> This ſaid, he threw all the curtains open, and ſpied the Engliſh Gentleman ſhivering behind in a corner. Then, with a countenance inflam'd with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited fury, he vented his rage on me in theſe termes, <hi>How now, you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Whore, Do you abuſe me thus? You could feign Chaſtity and Reſervation <pb n="38" facs="tcp:59287:26"/>to intrap me, and yet make a beggarly Raſcall here come lye with you, which is a favour I could not obtaine of your Jadeſhip, till you ſaw my Paſſion was growne to the height of extremity. What an affront is this to a perſon of Honour? Ha! You'le repent it at leiſure: To morrow Ile ſend to fetch away all the Goods I had given you, and you will finde it no eaſie matter to meet with one will maintaine you at that height I did.</hi> While he walked vapouring in this manner to himſelf, <hi>Perretta</hi> and I ſlunk both out of the room, as if the fear of his fury had bidden us ſeek our own ſecurity by flight.</p>
            <p>Then addreſſing his ſpeech to the poor ſtranger, <hi>And you M. Villain</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I ſhall teach you what 'tis to corrupt Women in this nature, lay hold on him</hi> Steward, <hi>and ſecure him here till to morrow morning, and then Ile make him ſtretch for his unworthineſſe. Mi bi Shentelman</hi> (replied the frighted Forreiner in his broken language) <hi>Mi com from de antique Kins ofe Cotes, de creat fadergrand of tis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone of mi hat putted his life in danger mor as feif hunder tim for te ſervis of his Prins; and mi will do reſon to dee. What impudence is this?</hi> (anſwered my up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart Lord in great indignation) <hi>thou challengeſt me,</hi> Raſcall, <hi>dost thou deſerve to be wounded by my weapons? Goe, if thou wert not deſtined to die upon a Gibbet, I would make thee fight with the upper Scullion of my Kitchen.</hi> My diſtreſſed Amoriſt in the mean time, looked all about to ſee where his clothes were laid, believing if the Lord ſaw him in that ſumptuous Apparell, he would judge more favourably of his quality, and ſet a higher value upon the jewel of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by the coſtlineſſe of the Caſe. But before he had ſearched round the chamber, the ſwaggering <hi>Plumer</hi> was gone, leaving the naked Lover locked in with him that repreſented the Lords
<hi>Steward:</hi> there was no likelihood he ſhould finde what he ſought, for when <hi>Perretta</hi> and I ſeemed to run away frighted out of his chamber, we cleared the room of all lay near our hands, and carried them into the Garret, where we took Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>The Plumeleſſe Pigeon, fancying his life was in extreame danger, addreſſed multitudes of ſupplications to him that was intruſted as his guard to let him go: But the ſterne Steward anſwer'd, if he ſhould commit that fault, he ne're muſt dare appeare in his Lords preſence more, and ſo all the hopes he had of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for his former ſervices would be loſt. This made the Priſoner ſeek his cloathes with more diligence than before, to take ſome mony out of his Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and offer him: But finding none of his veſtments, he ſtripped a Bracelet of curious round Pearles from his Wriſt, and ſaid he would give him that in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of his favour, if he would reſtore him his liberty: <hi>Sir</hi> (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the falſe <hi>Steward,</hi> accepting his Preſent) <hi>It is not the value of your Gift can move my heart to decline from my ſworn obedience, but the high merits I conſider in your perſon, oblige me to the reſolution of complying with your deſires; for Ile aſſure you, what I have received from your hand, will not countervaile the Tithe of that I might expect from my Lords bounty, if I betrayed him not, as I ſhall by releaſing you; However Ile venture his displeaſure, and ſet you cleare of this Howe, but to morrow you muſt not faile to leave this City, and returne with all poſſible ſpeed into your own Country, for if you linger any time in</hi> France,
<hi>the authority of the perſon you have offended is ſo great in every Province, that ſhould you have the misfortune to be apprehended, you will find nothing capable to expiate your crime but death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the poor Engliſh-man contenting himſelf with a paire of pitifull ratter'd breeches (that dragged in the dirt as he went) glad he was got into the open ſtreets, ran with as much haſt to his lodging, as if all the Hangmans Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds had been at his heeles. Next morning Fear repreſenting the Danger he might incurre by ſtaying any longer in
<hi>Paris,</hi> made him remove his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and begin his march for
<hi>England;</hi> where being arrived, I am confident he made his braggs how he had injoyed one of the World's rareſt Beauties, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe to a Principall Noble man of <hi>France:</hi> Me thinks I heare with what Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis <pb n="39" facs="tcp:59287:26"/>he related the adventures of his amorous ſtealths, eſteeming his money well employed, and deſiring ſo remarkable a Hiſtory ſhould be eternized by the Pen of ſome famous Author in a new
<hi>Romance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All thoſe, who had aſſiſted in the management of this Cheat, had their due ſhares of the <hi>Cake,</hi> but I alone had the
<hi>Beane;</hi> for my gain was greater than any of the reſt. By ſuch tricks as this we got an indifferent honeſt liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, neither was the
<hi>Juſtice</hi> troubled with any complaints of us; for we carried on our deſignes with too much ſecrecy, to be diſcovered: And ſo, I think, our
<hi>Vices</hi> were <hi>Vertues,</hi> in regard they were kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fortune</hi> weary of ſhewing me her <hi>Fore-parts,</hi> while I expos'd my own to any Comer, turn'd me at laſt her <hi>Back ſide.</hi> The firſt <hi>croſſe-blow</hi> I felt from her (formerly indulgent) hand, was when <hi>Monſieur de la Fontaine</hi> (whom I have already mentioned) met <hi>Marſault,</hi> and knowing him by his Gate or Garb, watched him till he entred our houſe, where, by chance, his eye diſcovered me at the window. Mervailing to ſee me transformed into the habit of a <hi>Damoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle,</hi> he inquired of ſome he knew in our ſtreet, how I lived, yet learned no more of my deportments, than he before conjectur'd: But my neighbours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding by his relation, I was no better than a Chamber-maid, cryed me down more than uncurrent Money, inſomuch I could never ſet foot into the ſtreets, without receiving ſome affront. After this, <hi>la Fontaine</hi> meeting <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault</hi> another time at better advantage, accoſted him, and charging him for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving robb'd his houſe, raiſed a terrible hurly-burly in the ſtreets, yet could not carry him to priſon; for ſome of his Aſſociates arriving amidſt theſe Broils, made their way through the gazing multitude, and reſcued him out of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants hands, recompencing their valour at their retreat, with the purchaſe of two faire Cloaks they twitched from a couple of gaping fooles, that intereſſed themſelves in what concerned them not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marſault</hi> ſcap'd narrowly that bout, but fifteen daies after his luck was not ſo good; for having robb'd a principall Citizens houſe, the Watch appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending him, incaged him ſo cloſe, there was no poſſibility of flight: ſo his Proceſſe being ended in two daies, he was ſent to the place of Execution, where his neck felt the weight of all the reſt of his body.</p>
            <p>This infamy reflecting upon <hi>Perretta</hi> and me, becauſe he was every day in our company, made us fear ſome diſaſter or calamity would befall us, for we began already to feele our ſupport but ſlender: One day the Commiſſary co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to our houſe, with thoughts to receive the Tribute he uſed to levie, found what he expected not: For, three Gentlemen, that had paſt the condition of calme Novices, being at that time in my company, gave him ſo rude an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, that he was forced to make but one ſtep from the top of the ſtaires to the bottome. This bred a jealouſie in his thoughts, <hi>Perretta</hi> had betrayed him, therefore he endeavoured to turn us preſently out of that quarter: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we diſlodged, we reſolved to uſe ſome trick to be revenged of his malice: His name was <hi>Lucrin,</hi> and his diſpoſition was not unanſwerable, being ſordidly griping, and of a baſe dull temper; But there was another of the ſame faculty, called <hi>Morizet,</hi> who lived in a ſtreet ſomewhat more remote; a joviall merry ſoule, and no enemy to perſons of our profeſſion: This Commiſſary uſing to viſite us ſometimes, we acquainted <hi>Lucrin</hi> with his coming, who took it as a great affront to him, and an encroaching upon his Prerogative, aſſuring us he would ſuffer no other Officer to meddle in his jurisdiction: At length, to make our accuſation good againſt <hi>Morizet</hi> (who we affirmed had ſpoken much to the prejudice and diſparagement of the other) one night we ſent for
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizet,</hi> as if we had ſome earneſt buſineſſe to impart to him, having firſt hid <hi>Lucrin</hi> in a little cloſet next my chamber: at his arrivall he found four Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in my company, whom he taking upon him to examine what they came to <pb n="40" facs="tcp:59287:27"/>doe with me, they anſwered, they would give him no account, and I (to ſecond them) ſaid I was not obliged to declare my actions to him; for, <hi>Lucrin</hi> had told me he had no power to act as Commiſſary in our Quarter. Hereupon he replyed,
<hi>Lucrin</hi> lyed like a Sot, and ſo continued railing againſt
<hi>Lucrin,</hi> in ſuch vilifying termes, as made him (like an enraged Lyon) fly out of his Den upon him, and (for want of other weapons) batter his face with his fiſts. <hi>Morizet</hi> to defend himſelfe, and not ſeeme ingratefull, return'd him as many blowes with a ſoure cudgell he light upon by chance; and the hotter the combat grew, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were we pleaſed. At laſt comming to cloze, they ſcratch'd, bit, and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together upon the ground, where they ſo pummeld each other, that their eyes look'd like eggs potch'd in black butter, and the reſt of their faces, red, blew, and yellow, like pieces of <hi>China</hi> Taffetas. There wanted a third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary to part theſe two, who, inſtead of making others keep the Peace, were ready to teare out one anothers throat. But the Gentlemen who accompanyed us, at length thought good to performe that office, one of them (as they went to ſeparate em) ſaying with an imperious tone,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">How now, <hi>Raſcalls,</hi> have you the impudence to quarrell in my preſence, What, will you raiſe a ſcandall upon ſuch an honeſt houſe as this is? If your impertinence provoke my fury any farther, I ſhall ſoon make Mince-meat of you both: ſo let's have peace preſently, embrace each other, I bid you, and that quickly, nay let me ſee you kiſs too, and ſhake hands.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this command the Commiſſaries left fighting, both much aſhamed for what they had done, yet the animoſity their hearts abounded with would not permit them to be ſo eaſily agreed: However to confirme their ſeeming Amity, the Gentleman commanded his Lacquay to get ſomething for a <hi>Collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and ſome wine to make them drink together.</p>
            <p>We thought it not convenient to ſend for any thing abroad, but made them be contented with what we had in the houſe; ſo with ſome eggs that remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of our Saturday night ſupper, and a few ſlices of bacon, a
<hi>Froiſe</hi> was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, and ſerved in with great pomp and magnificence. <hi>Come</hi> (ſaid the Gentleman to the two Commiſſaries)
<hi>you muſt eat with me, or Ile eat you.</hi> That ſaid, he put his hand to the diſh firſt, and <hi>Morizet,</hi> without farther invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, fell to exerciſe his teeth, but <hi>Lucrin</hi> out of ſhame, or a ſullen reſervation, ſlighted the courteſie, inſomuch as the Gentleman ſeeming diſpleaſed, forced open his mouth, and holding him by the chin with one hand, and taking a piece of the <hi>Froiſe</hi> with the other, flung it in as a Maſon does Mortar off his Trowel, into a hole that wants ſtopping: his Eyes, Beard and Doublet, had each their ſhare of the ſpattering; ſo ſeeing there was no remedy, he reformed his croſſe-grain'd humour, and became more ſociable. After this the Lacquay was commanded to give <hi>Morizet</hi> a glaſſe of Wine, and he bidden to drink a Health to <hi>Lucrin:</hi> So without farther ceremony, taking the Glaſſe, <hi>Here Mr. Commiſſary,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>Ile drink to you, to let you ſee I harbour no malice in my heart: The Wiſeman ſayes, We muſt forget injuries.</hi> The next Plot was to make <hi>Lucrin</hi> drink to
<hi>Morizet,</hi> which he did with ſuch ſhew of reluctancie, as his hand ſhaking (through feare or diſdaine) above halfe the Wine was ſpilt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Glaſſe reach'd his mouth: However ſeeing 'twas in vain to withſtand their wills, <hi>I will drink to you becauſe I muſt</hi> (ſaid he with a trembling voice.) And after that he would neither eate nor drink more in their company, neither was he much intreated; <hi>Morizet</hi> did that office for him, and ſtirr'd not till our Bottle was ſuck'd out.</p>
            <p>After this refection, they deſired to repaire home, but ſeeing they had torn their Ruffs to pieces in the conflict, loth to goe through the ſtreets in that equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, they intreated the Gentlemen to give their Lacquayes leave to goe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire their wives to ſend them other Linne: The Gallants anſwered, they could not ſpare their Servants to goe ſo farre, but there were Semſters nearer could <pb n="41" facs="tcp:59287:27"/>furniſh them, if they would ſend for one, they were willing to doe them that courteſie. So one of our neighbours was fetch'd preſently, who having the watch-word brought none but broad Bands with deep laces that were not for their Wear, beſides making her price, was foure times more than they were worth; the pittifull fellowes (unwilling to part with ſo much money) were forc'd to ſneak home without, and hide their noſes with their long Cloaks for feare of being knowne; onely <hi>Morizet</hi>'s ingenuity furniſh'd him with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention to put his handkerchief about his Neck, which ſerv'd inſtead of a falling band.</p>
            <p>Next day the Gentlemen went in a Coach to their houſes (well attended with ſtout lacquayes) and forc'd them to beare them company to our houſe, where taking <hi>Perretta</hi> and me (as if they intended to carry us ſomewhere to be merry, and make a perfect reconcilement) they brought us all together to the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and the Comedians (already inſtructed by thoſe Gallants of all the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages betwixt the two Commiſſaries) made their Scuffle the ſubject of all their Drollerie, to the grand ſatisfaction of all the Spectators, except the two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants; who ſenſible of that publique affront, complotted how to be reveng'd, and though they left us without any ſhew of diſtaſte, they fomented a reſolution to contrive our ruine, laying their private enmities aſide to unite their powers againſt us, as occaſion ſhould invite them to doe us miſchief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But we, fearing the ſtorme ſhould break unawares upon us, to ſhelter our ſelves from theirs as well as others malicious practiſes, forthwith forſook that quarter, where I confeſſe we had made an indifferent good harveſt.</p>
            <p>We retired into the Suburbs to a paultrie little houſe afarre off, where we remembred with regret the high cheere we uſed to have in our former dwelling, for there it was very meane, having but a ſlender ſtock of money left after our too extravagant expence. This miſerable life (I believe) was a principall cauſe of a great indiſpoſition beſieg'd
<hi>Perretta,</hi> for Melancholly and diſcontent to ſee her ſelf fallen from a plentifull condition to calamity, gaining the aſcendance over her Spirit, the good woman felt her ſelf drawing neerer diſſolution, and therefore, as moſt People uſe in like extremity, ſhe would impart ſome docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before her death. Conſidering me as her daughter, I received from her dying mouth very apparent teſtimonies of a Cordiall affection; of all her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets and Maximes ſhe profeſs'd ſhe concealed not any from my knowledge, and beſides gave me divers wholeſome Counſells, which I have ſince made good uſe of. In ſumme no ſcruple nor ſuperſtition harbour'd in her heart: She lived ſo <hi>roundly,</hi> that I imagine (if what is reported of the other World be true) the reſt of humane Soules now play at <hi>Bowles</hi> with her's. She knew no more what belonged to remorſe or Caſes of conſcience than thoſe of <hi>Topinambou;</hi> for (ſhe ſaid) if ſhe ever had heard any diſcourſe thereof in her youth, ſhe had lived long enough to forget it, as a thing that ſerv'd for nothing but to diſturb the Mind's repoſe. She had often told me before the riches of this World are ſo common, that they ought not to appertaine more peculiarly to one than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that it argued ingenuity and wiſdome in any one to take a ſhare (though out of others hands) if fortune favour'd the deſigne with a convenient opportunity. <hi>For (ſaid ſhe) I came naked into this World, and naked I will return, If I have got any of others goods, I ſhall not carry them with me, let them goe ſeek where they are and take them, it nere ſhall trouble me. What! If I ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht after my death for committing that which they call Fellony or Theft, might not I with reaſon anſwer my accuſers, that 'twere injuſtice to bring me into the World to live, and not permit me to take thoſe things requiſite to maintaine a</hi> Life?</p>
            <p>After ſeverall ſuch diſcourſes her ſoule took leave of her Carcaſe, which I buryed without any Pompe, as ſhe injoyned me, for ſhe know there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more unneceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:59287:28"/>Soone after her deceaſe I procur'd ſome new acquaintance, that furniſh'd me with a little Belly-timber; But the loſſe of my good Mother was ſo ſenſible, beſides the ill hap I had to incounter now and then ſome perſons, too well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my former carriages, that I reſolv'd to leave <hi>Paris,</hi> and to remove my ſtation to the City of <hi>Roan.</hi> My Beauty was yet powerfull enough to attract me many Viſitants, but making no reſpect or diſtinction of Perſons, in effect being a ſtable for all Horſes, among others I met with a running Nagg, by whoſe virulency I was ſo paid, that in ſhort time I found my body infected with a foul diſeaſe: Curſed be thoſe brought it into <hi>France;</hi> it diſturbs the pleaſures of well diſpoſed people, and it is favourable to none but Chirurgions, who indeed owe
<hi>Candles</hi> to one of our <hi>Kings,</hi> for leading his Souldiers <hi>to Naples</hi> to get it there, and bring the ſeeds of it hither. The onely happineſſe in my misfortune was, that an honeſt and gratefull Chirurgion, to whom I had done ſome courteſie before, phyſick'd me for much leſſe than any other of his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion would have taken. I will not entertain you any longer with theſe Ordures, though I know you are none of thoſe ſqueamiſh people; to whom a foul relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſavours as ill as the thing it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Let it ſuffice to tell you, I took a voyage (as they ſay in
<hi>Bavaria</hi>) to ſee the Emperour inthron'd, and at my return, I found my face ſo changed, I was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to make my recourſe to Art; Painting, Waters and Perfumes, were the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remedies I uſed to repaire the ruines my Body and Face ſuſtained. Beſides, I began to conſult my Looking-glaſſe for new attractions, &amp; practiſed a certain affected manner of ſpeech, that infinitely inchanted thoſe I had a deſire to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap. At laſt, a man very rich, and without office, became ſo vanquiſhed by my charms, that he took me into his own houſe, to injoy me there with more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: I grant he might have found a handſomer Miſtreſs than I, and ſo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf; but there was ſomething in my humour ſympathiſed ſo with his diſpoſition, that he preferred me before all others of my ſex. The cauſe of our Separation proceeded from a little brangling betwixt us, becauſe I made more havock of his goods, and ſpent his money more laviſhly than he was willing to permit.</p>
            <p>The practice of my firſt profeſſion, being yet freſh in my memory, that was my preſent refuge; I applyed my ſelfe eagerly to it a long time, refuſing no body that brought what would help to make the Pot boyle. While I was in the height of my trading, a certain Meacock (that was ſoon after to be marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) deſirous to know before-hand in what parts to attaque his enemies in <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pids</hi> combats, where he never yet had ſhewn his valour, was addreſſed to me (by a Kinſman of his) to receive inſtructions. Having been at my Lodging one Sunday after dinner, and informed I was gone to the Sermon, thither came he to finde me out; At his arrivall, the Preacher falling upon the relation of the firſt part of <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>'s life, inveighed bitterly againſt <hi>Courtezans,</hi> and repreſented ſo lively the pains prepared for them in the other World, that my Lover ſaid to himſelf, he might well enough go back again, or ſeek another Miſtreſs to do him that courteſie, imagining I ſhould be touch'd with too much remorſe by the end of the Sermon, to continue that life any longer: But at the Sermons end, he finding opportunity to accoſt me, after he had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd me his thought of my converſion, I return'd him this anſwer (which, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, in your judgements, will ſavour of much impiety; However it is no matter, I come not hither to make you believe I repent of my paſt iniquities) <hi>Inſooth (Friend) my ſoule muſt be very weakly principled, to be ſtartled at the ſtories this prating Monk has told us; Don't I know well enough every one muſt follow his owne trade? He makes it his profeſſion to amuſe the ſimple people with his Prattle, diſſwading them from haunting deboſh'd and lewd companies, where they idly conſume their time, perſons and purſes, or become ingaged in ſome despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and unneceſſary quarrell: And I exerciſe my part to quench the Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſe</hi> 
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:59287:28"/>of men by Charity. Thus was my Novice paid, and being a good ſilly ſoule, according to the ſtamp of that old ignorant Age, when people wip'd their Noſes on their ſleeves, he wonder'd at my libertine humour, which he took to be very wicked and inconſiſtent with his goodly Religion. To make my ſtory ſhort, we went together from Church to my Chamber, where I read him a <hi>Love-Lecture,</hi> and taught him what he deſired to learn; but my inſtructions made ſo deep an impreſſion, as upon the <hi>Verge</hi> of the <hi>Axletree</hi> of his
<hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſme,</hi> he was forced to bear a <hi>Cancer</hi> as well as the
<hi>Zodiack;</hi> and he was ſo thorougly pepper'd, that before he had accompanied his tender Bride eight nights, ſhe felt the malignity of its influence diſpeſred through her whole body. Was he not a pretty Proficient, to gain ſo much in ſo ſhort an Apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip?</p>
            <p>At length, Time and hard Labour ſo furrowed my fore-head, and impair'd the Complexion of my Countenance, as <hi>Ceruſe</hi> and
<hi>Vermillion</hi> were not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to re-imbelliſh my face. By little and little the number of my Lovers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and none came to knock at my doore but ſome raſcally Roiſters, leſſe furniſhed with Money than Minde to do any miſchief to ſatisfie their deſires: This conſtrained me to ſcrew my ſelf into the acquaintance of innocent Virgins, and get into the Order of thoſe Matrons that procure Commodities for young Cuſtomers. And that I might more handſomly perform this Office, I reform'd my habit into a holy Siſters, and there was no indulgence to be gain'd, or other publique Devotion, thorough all the City, but I went daggling among the throng: I knew the high-ſpirited Sparks by their looks, and when I had crept into their acquaintance, I conducted them into places where they received the contentment they deſired; If any Gentleman was intangled in Love's Labyrinth, I imployed all my Art and Induſtry to do him ſervice, and cunningly conveyed his Letters to his Miſtreſs's hands.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Francion</hi> prepare your attention, and obſerve what I ſhall tell you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Lauretta,</hi> for I ſhall preſently enter into the relation of her ſtory.</p>
            <p>Being in the Countey with a certain Goſſip of mine, one evening a fancy took me to walk out alone, and paſſing through a private place, remote from any houſes, I deſcry'd a man carrying ſomething under his Cloak, and as he came within a matter of twenty paces of me, the noiſe of a Child crying, made me ſend my eyes about, to diſcover where it might be; but the nearer we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd, the more aſcertain'd I was that he muſt have it under his arm: <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carry you that Child?</hi> (ſaid I to him)
<hi>Whoſe is it?</hi> At theſe words, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his March, he told me, he was carrying it to a Village not farre thence, where he believed he ſhould get a good Nurſe for it. I conjured him ſo much, that at length he confeſſed it was a ſecret ſinne of a young Gentleman in that Countrey, who had been ſomething too familiar with one of his Mothers Maids, but he would not acquaint me with his Name. Though Night had already put her Mask over the face of Heaven, my curioſity invited me to take the little creature into my arms, to ſee if it were pretty; mean time he that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd me it ſhew'd me his heeles, ſaying, he went to ſpeak with one of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marades; The Pledge he left in my hands, little pleaſing me, I laid it gently upon the graſs, and ran after him, but to ſmall purpoſe; for, he was ſo light footed, that in ſhort time I loſt ſight of him; beſides, I heard a great Dog barking near the child, as I conjectur'd, which made me haſt back, fearing it. might receive ſome miſchief. Compaſſion mov'd me to take it up, and carry it to the houſe I ſo journ'd in, where, by the help of candle-light, I found it was a Girle of a moſt exquiſite feature and pure complexion, as commonly all the of privae <hi>Amoretta</hi>'s are, becauſe in thoſe ſtollen pleaſures the Parents act with more vigour and affection, and the Mothers are generally befriended by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with more than ordinary beauties to heighten the deſires of their <hi>Amoriſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:59287:29"/>I knew at <hi>Rouen,</hi> a Nurſe that had ſuch ſuperfluity of Milk, as ſhe was eaſily perſwaded to ſuckle another Child beſide her owne, provided I would make good a ſmall ſumme of mony I promiſed her. After the Child was wean'd I took her home and call'd her alwayes <hi>Lauretta,</hi> as he that left her with me told me ſhe had been baptized. She coſt me little the keeping, for all the Ladies of pleaſure in the City, were ſo taken with thoſe pretty Bloomings of Beauty in her Face, that they would have her, by turnes, whole Moneths together in their houſes; and indeed, her company was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together uſeleſſe; for, going along the ſtreets with them, ſhe made them be often taken not for what they were, but for honeſt Women that had been married.</p>
            <p>Her yeares advancing her to the uſe of Reaſon, there was a pretty Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation among them, who ſhould render her Miſtreſſe of moſt Gentileſſes, and teach her the moſt witty and ſubtile Diſcourſes, to ſerve her upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions: By the'e Inſtructions, and her owne Obſervation, ſhe learned a number of rare pieces of Craft to intrap and amuſe Lovers. When ſhe was come to a growth that might admit a Copulative, I took her againe to my owne tutorage, fearing ſhe might let that full-blown Flower of her Virginity be cropp'd, without receiving any conſiderable valuation for ſo precious a Jewell. I did not account <hi>Rouen</hi> a place worthy enough of her, whom the benigne Heavens had imbeliſhed with all the attractive faculties and perfections deſirable in our ſex: So I reſolved to remove the Scene to <hi>Paris,</hi> where I preſumed I ſhould quickly gain enough to countervail my charge and trouble in breeding her. I uſed no more the <hi>Gentlewomans</hi> attire, thoſe vanities I had long ſince laid aſide; neither did I ſuffer her to go in the Garb of a
<hi>Damoiſelle,</hi> but weare a neat white Dreſſing, with a handſome
<hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> Lace, which made her look ſo pretty, Ile aſſure you I am not able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it. As ſhe followed me along the ſtreets, we could hear ſome ſay ſhe had a face like an Angel, others commend the colour and curling of her curious Haire, or fall into admiration of her delicate Skin, with the gracefull riſing of her lovely Breſts, which ſhe wearing half diſcovered, ſeemed like a Paire of pretty Promontories or Land-marks to direct <hi>Loves</hi> Champions ſafe into the ſtreights. When any one ſent an earneſt looke after her, my watchfull eye preſently met with his, and if he followed us home I would make her ſtand at the doore, that as he paſs'd he might have a fuller view, and become more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in the fetters of her Beauty.</p>
            <p>My Judgement perſwaded me it was then time to advance her to the higheſt <hi>Claſſe,</hi> and imbue her with the moſt learned leſſons of our Science. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I governed her no longer as a Child, but began to teach her what was neceſſary to make her Barque arrive at a happy Port in the Sea of this World.</p>
            <p>After theſe inſtructions, ſhe was no Niggard of her amorous glances, to thoſe ſeemed taken with her, and (believe me) ſhe could arm her eyes with ſuch a commanding ſweetneſs, as every Beam they ſhot, recompenced the loſs of her Look with the conqueſt of a Heart. Obſerve a little the Art I made her uſe, to the end every one might eſteem me one of thoſe they call Women of Honour. If at any time I turned towards her, ſhe preſently bent her looks downwards, as if ſhe durſt not then ſpeak to men with her Eyes, as ſhe took the liberty to doe, when my Back was towards her.</p>
            <p>Among the young Wooers ſhe had charmed one named
<hi>Valderan,</hi> was much gallanter than the reſt, and (as I conceived) richer. Dwelling within few doors of our houſe, he ſoon met with opportunity to accoſt us, and ask'd me leave to give us now and then a viſit, which I granted, with thanks for the honour, I ſaid, we ſhould receive in his company: But I injoy'd <pb n="45" facs="tcp:59287:29"/>
               <hi>Lauretta</hi> to perſonate the ſcornefull Lady, and anſwer his Careſſes with an invincible Rigour, untill he fill'd her hands with Crownes of Gold, which I told her were the <hi>Starres</hi> that give the quality of <hi>Gods</hi> upon
<hi>Earth,</hi> to thoſe that have the diſpoſall of them; as the
<hi>Planets</hi> which are in the <hi>Heavens</hi> doe give the ſame honour to the Intelligences that govern them. Nay, I am a learned Woman (Gentlemen) though you believe it not: Well, but I ſhall let you ſee that I have read ſometimes in good Books, where I have learn'd to ſay <hi>Phoebus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Remonſtrances were not neglected by <hi>Lauretta,</hi> ſhe was ſo diſcreet and punctuall in obſerving them, that every time
<hi>Valderan</hi> came to Viſit her, ſhe would make her complaints to him alone, that her Aunt (meaning me) was the hardeſt and moſt covetous woman in the world: <hi>My Father hath ſent me money ſeverall times, to make me fine new Clothes (would the cunning Baggage ſay but ſhe will buy me nothing; nay, I believe in ſtead of furniſhing me, ſhe has employed it to ſupply her own particular neceſſities, though (God knowes) ſhe is well enough paid beſide for my Penſion.</hi> After ſhe had prepared
<hi>Valderan</hi>'s credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity by this lie, ſhe minced it no longer but boldly asked him money to buy her a new Coat or Gown, and when he told her he could hardly ſatisfie her demands, ſhe anſwered, <hi>Ha! how do you think to make me ſenſible of the affection you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, if you will not undergoe ſome difficulty to expreſſe it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this, and other like ſubtilties, ſhe skrewed at length a ſmall ſumme of Money out of her penurious Pretendant, for which he thought her obliged to give him the intire Poſſeſſion of her Heart, but he was forced to relinquiſh that opinion, when he ſaw ſhe ſlighted him more than formerly.</p>
            <p>Mean time, a gallant ſpruce Exchecquer-man, named
<hi>Chaſtel,</hi> inſinuated himſelf into our acquaintance, by means of a ſervant Maid we kept, who, according to my inſtructions, had ſo handſomly repreſented him our neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, that to procure our good eſteem, and indevour to obtain a remedy for the affection be bare
<hi>Lauretta,</hi> he ſent us ſeverall conſiderable Preſents, which powerfully pleaded his intereſts, and infinitely captived our thoughts. He was a perfect <hi>Drolle,</hi> given to his pleaſures enough, but never could be made guilty of entertaining thoſe fond tranſports of <hi>Love,</hi> ſome Fondlings are diſtempered with; He ſhunn'd thoſe Paſſions that might raiſe mutinies in his Minde, and could not indure one thing ſhould be refuſed him twice; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding his diſpoſition, I failed not to ſhew him the beſt countenance I could, and my Niece likewiſe paid his reſpects with a demeanour no way diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging.</p>
            <p>One Evening, as he was newly gone out of our houſe, we came home, and met <hi>Valderan</hi> at the door, who came to ſpend ſome idle hours with us; <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta,</hi> after her cuſtome, preſently ran to the Looking-glaſſe, to ſee if her Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing were not crumpled, or any of her Curls diſordered: Our maid ſeeing her very buſie in gazing on her ſelf, burſt into ſuch a ſudden laughter as provok'd her to ask the reaſon. She, who was more wanton than witty, without diſguiſing the buſineſs anſwer'd,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">
                  <hi>Monſieur Chaſtel</hi> was but newly gone out as you came, but you little think what he did while he ſtayed here, your looking and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſying ſo in the glaſſe, recalls his Poſtures to my memory; he took the ſame Glaſſe and ſtood a while thus contemplating his—you underſtand me well enough, I need explaine my ſelfe no further.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This ſaid, ſhe fell againe into a fit of laughter, lowder than before; but <hi>Lauretta</hi>'s ingenuity, preſently prompted her to an action incomparably opportune to poſſeſſe <hi>Valderan</hi> (who heard all was ſaid) with an opinion of extraordinary modeſty in her, and to repaire the ſilly Servants indiſcretion: for, as if ſhe had received the higheſt affront imaginable, with a compleatly counterfeited choler, ſhe ſnatch'd up a certaine piece of Iron, and broke the Glaſſe into ſmall bits, ſaying ſhe would ne're ſee her face againe where ſuch
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59287:30"/>ugly things had been ſhewn. <hi>Valderan,</hi> with a moderate ſmile, told her, ſhe was of too cholerick a humour, there remained nothing on the glaſs of that object <hi>Chaſtel</hi> had preſented her; yet I know within himſelf he commended this action, and was glad to have incounter'd ſo diſcreet and modeſt a Miſtreſs, as all
<hi>Lauretta</hi>'s carriage and diſcourſe ſtill ſpake her: And in effect, this, with ſome other reſervations, made him not ſolicite her with ſo much importunity to allay his flames, imagining he ſhould never obtain any thing of her but by the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable way of Wedlock. Yet having no great deſire to bind himſelf ſo ſoon in ſuch ſtrait Bands, he reſolved to tempt Fortune again, and try to win his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs by proofs of an extream paſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chaſtel</hi> had ſo robb'd the King to inrich us, that we ſhould have been the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefulleſt creatures living, had we not done ſomething to acknowledge his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities. At laſt I promiſed to let him hit the Mark his inclinations aimed at; and <hi>Lauretta</hi> (whoſe amorous Itch already required a remedy) needed no great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion to contribute her conſent.</p>
            <p>The ſame night ſhe was to ſacrifice her Virginity to the Deities of Love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt ready to ſurrender the Fort (ſo long capitulated for before) to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous aſſailant; <hi>Valderan</hi> came with a Muſitian of his acquaintance before our windowes, and made him ſing ſome very agreeable <hi>Airs,</hi> which with the ſound of the Lute, hindered me from taking my repoſe; So led by the eares with that delightfull harmony, I came down into the Hall, and my Maid with me, thinking to hear it there more diſtinctly; but obſerve the vanity of our young Lover: That we ſhould take notice, he gave us that <hi>Serenade,</hi> he cauſed ſome of his company to call him by his name aloud. But knowing it was not he that ſung, and conſidering to preſent his Lady with onely bare Words and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſique, was little better than nothing; I bade my maid give him a hint of his backwardneſſe: The Song ended, ſhe open'd the lower window, and he thinking it had been <hi>Lauretta,</hi> immediately left his company to come to her, but finding it was not ſhe, he eagerly ask'd where ſhe was.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">Do you believe (anſwer'd the Maid) that ſhe is ſuch a fool to break her ſleep to come hear you claw 2. or 3. ill-favour'd Cats-guts? What's all your Airy hollow meat good for? You may play long enough upon your Barn-doore, Gittern, Lantern, Cittern, and Virgin-holes,
<hi>Lauretta</hi> cares much for ſuch entertainment; you think, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ſpend your night dreaming of her, ſhe ſpends hers thinking on you, remove that folly from your fancy; for now is ſhe ſleeping open legg'd in her bed, with a ſecurity that admits of neither Care or Fear: If you love her health, bid your companion forbear playing, leſt you diſturb her reſt; neither is the preſent you give her ſo conſiderable, but ſhe may content her ſelf well enough without it. Thou art a jeering ſlut (ſaid
<hi>Valderan</hi>) I can preſent her nothing more ſuitable to her quality than Muſique; for, Doſt not thou know that is the onely thing we give the greateſt Deities to invite them to love us, and thank them for lending us their ſuccour? Marry you tell us fine ſtories indeed (replyed the Maid) you take <hi>Lauretta</hi> then for a <hi>Deity,</hi> Will you ſee what's in her Cloſe ſtoole, or eat a Bit if your ſtomack ſerve?

<hi>Lover,</hi> making your addreſſes thus by Day. If my Miſtreſs were as croſſe as thou, ſaid <hi>Valderan,</hi> I ſhould be reduc'd to the extremity of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but I believe ſhe has a better opinion of my Muſick. 'Tis like one of your Country-men indeed (anſwered the bold Wench) to conceit if ſhe <pb n="47" facs="tcp:59287:30"/>heard your Song, ſhe could not chooſe but be deeper in love with you; but obſerve what a ſilly vanity you are poſſeſſed with; if the Song pleaſed her eare, ſhe ſhould rather love him that ſung it: As for you, what Miracle have you ever done, that another cannot perform the like? The greateſt Fool breathing may bring the moſt excellent Muſitian can be found to ſing before a Window. It is not with the voice I ever imagined to acquire the favour of my Miſtreſſe, replyed <hi>Valderan,</hi> but with the extream affection I was deſirous to declare her, though by another's ſinging. That's handſome I faith (ſaid my Maid againe) a man that ner'e was ſenſible of the power of Love, may then (as well as you) make another ſay, he ſuffers the Keeneſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that paſſion e're inflicted upon poor Mortall.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valderan,</hi> ſeeing there was nothing to be got but ſcorn and ſhame from this ſcoffing Wench (moſt part of whoſe tart replies were framed out of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions I had given her) marched home again with his muſick &amp; I went to ſee my Niece lock'd faſt in
<hi>Caſtel</hi>'s arms (both breathleſs with delight, having kept time in their recreative pleaſures with the Luteniſt's warbling notes.) I told
<hi>Lauret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> not before her Bedfellow, who had made that
<hi>Serenade,</hi> fearing to raiſe ſome umbrage in his thoughts; but next day I gave her a perfect account of the whole ſtory, and conſidering the Miſerie Women ſometimes fall into, by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing the trade I made her undertake, I conceived it would be good to get her a Husband as ſoon as poſſible, and if we could inſnare the paſſionate <hi>Valderan</hi> in her Pit-fall, it would be a good advantage for us both: for, I imagined him infinitely rich and made account to wear out the remainder of my dayes quietly in his houſe, out of the danger of thoſe Ship-wreeks I ſo much apprehended Next time <hi>Lauretta</hi> had any private conference with him, ſhe fail'd not to let him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how extreamely ſhe was taken with his perfections, yet his credulous Vanitie would deceive him, if it ſuggeſted him to think he ſhould ever obtaine any favour of her without making her his wife.</p>
            <p>Paſſion having at that time a greater predominance over him than ever, he preſently took a piece of paper and writ her a Promiſe of Marriage, thinking to have injoyed her after: But when he was gone, and ſhe had ſhewn me the writing, not contented with that I ſayed, he muſt reſolve to marry her in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, or at leaſt paſſe over a good part of his Eſtate to injoy her in Private. As we had almoſt brought him to agree to one of theſe propoſitions, we ſaw him one day dragg'd ſhamefully to priſon (where I believe he is yet) for having af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted divers Merchants and others. When we underſtood all his Gallantry was mainteined by borrowing, we made no more eſteem of him than of the Kennell dirt, and his Promiſe was flun'g into the fire as a thing not worthy to be preſerved.</p>
            <p>By this time our Exchecquer-man began to ſurfeit with Delight, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had ſo cooled his Paſſion, that he neither came to ſee my Niece ſo often as he uſed, nor ſent ſuch frequent tokens. This conſtrain'd me to admit into my houſe ſeverall other Gallants, to whom I had the induſtry handſomly to make known our neceſſities: Some of theſe aſſiſted us a little, and others never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whit, but they were treated accordingly by <hi>Lauretta,</hi> who ſometimes paid their Complements with curſt frowns, and ſometimes derided them with ſuch witty and ſmart jeeres, as rendring them a ſcorn to the reſt of the company, wounded them to the very hearts. Many times playing at Cards with them, ſhe would take the liberty, in a jeſting manner, to ſweep up all their moneys, and never reſtore a penny; but ſhe did it with ſuch a grace, and pretty dexterity, as they could not for ſhame be offended at her frollique. Sometime there came for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fooles would be handling her boſome, as much to ſhew the fine Rings they wore, and dazle her eyes with their luſtre, as for any other intent. Then catching the hand faſt, would ſhe ſay, <hi>This hand is over-bold, 'tis too impudently raſh, it ſtrayes into any place where lawleſſe Deſires guide it, and in time of Warre <pb n="48" facs="tcp:59287:31"/>too it makes incurſions into the Enemies Countrey; But now I have caught the Traitour, Ile not let him go till he has paid his Ranſome.</hi> Then, ſlipping off the Ring, ſhe continu'd, <hi>Ha! look here, this will help to make us ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes the Ninny would ask her for it when he went away, then would ſhe anſwer laughing, <hi>That muſt remaine with me for ranſome of your hand; Did you not call me but even now your cruelleſt Enemie, recounting me the torments your paſſion made you ſuffer? You cannot but remember ſince that time we have neither made Peace nor Truce.</hi> If ſome dayes after he ſtill importun'd her to reſtore what ſhe had taken from him, and that it was of too conſiderable a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue to be ſo eaſily parted with, ſhe would re-deliver it, upon condition he would give her another Preſent at his own diſcretion. But in caſe ſhe ſaw it was of no very great price, ſhe would either keep it, and pay the owner with a jeſt, or ſay ſhe had pawn'd it, and then he muſt redeem it with a ſumme of money, if he would have it.</p>
            <p>She plaid a multitude of ſuch profitable pranks, never conſidering the beauty, courteſie, or gentileſs of any man to affect him more than others; for I had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn'd her to give ſuch fopperies any entertainment in her thoughts, but onely countenance thoſe whoſe pockets were beſt provided, &amp; her diſpoſition affecting variety of Men as well as of Cloaths, made her inclinable enough to follow my advice. Thoſe that were moſt prodigall in expence and gifts, had always the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in her eſteem, yet they muſt be very modeſt, and take the oath of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſie, before ſhe would admit them to the ſupreme degree of Love's felicity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe would ſtill preſerve the name of Chaſt.</p>
            <p>She ſeldome went abroad but upon Holy-daies, and look'd ſo gentile at home in her <hi>Damoiſel</hi>'s habit, that the faireſt Ladies of the Court might have been as envious of her beauty, as the other Sex inamour'd. A certain Noble-man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Alidan,</hi> ſeeing her in that equipage at the window, as he paſſed through our ſtreet, and vanquiſhed with her amiable looks, could not be ſatisfied till he had informed himſelf who ſhe was: But underſtanding ſhe was the ſame <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta,</hi> whoſe perfections had already ſpread her fame in the Court, he became more inflamed at the remembrance of theſe proofs often averred to him of her excellent Wit.</p>
            <p>He preſently framed a deſign to purchaſe the poſſeſſion of her, but imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning I would not part with her for what price ſoever, he conceived it neceſſary to take her away by force. He ſet ſo many ſpies in every corner over us, that we could ſtirre no whither, but he had preſently notice of our Motion; So, one evening, when I was gone abroad, he ſent a Gentleman of good faſhion in a Coach to our houſe, who, ſtepping in to <hi>Lauretta,</hi> made her believe he came from me, and that inſtead of going where I told her when I went out, I was gone to a gallant Gentlemans houſe where I expected her, and that Coach was ſent purpoſely to fetch her to me; By ill fortune <hi>Lauretta</hi> was in her beſt attire ready to take a walk, ſo ſhe needed not much intreaty to take the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Coach, beſides ſhe knew I uſed to goe often to that Gentlemans houſe where ſhe was told I was.</p>
            <p>The Coach arriving at <hi>Alidan</hi>'s houſe, ſhe was received and treated by her new Lover, as you may imagine: Though at firſt ſhe ſeemed to reſent this treachery as a high affront, and would not ſuffer him that had cheated her in this manner, to touch her by any meanes; yet at length, conſidering his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent quality, and the noble entertainment he made her, ſhe became more tame, and ſuffered her ſelfe to be overcome. Mean time, I was exceedingly perplext for her, and all my exerciſe was to trot from place to place, to ſee if ſhe were not in the houſes of ſome of thoſe Gentlemen had formerly made love to her.</p>
            <p>The third day after I loſt her, I met an honeſt man of my acquaintance, who <pb n="49" facs="tcp:59287:31"/>gave me direct inſtructions where to finde her. Thither went I immediately, and ask'd to ſpeak with
<hi>Alidan,</hi> whom I told, He was the man (as I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd) had given order to take away a certain Niece of mine that lived with me, and I beſeech'd him to excuſe my boldneſſe for coming to know of him if
'twere true. After he had denyed it,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">Sir, (ſaid I) I will not trouble you with many Words, you need not conceale the fact from me, for I don't in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have her againe, ſhee's in too good a hand, I come onely to let you know, you need not have made uſe of either Deceit or Violence to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe her, had you but demanded her of me, I ſhould readily have reſign'd her to your will.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Hearing me ſpeak with ſo much freedome and ſincerity, he diſcover'd me the whole Plot, and having given me a reward that might content me, he led me to ſee <hi>Lauretta</hi> in lodgings on the hinder part of his houſe. She made me divers excuſes for not ſending me word what was become of her, proteſting ſhe could not by any meanes procure the liberty to doe it. It was no ſmall vexation to me (you muſt think) to be thus robb'd of her Company, but Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity taught me to be contented. Sometimes
<hi>Alidan</hi> ſent her into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, ſometimes kept her in the City, and moſt commonly in other lodgings, not at his owne houſe. Then I went more frequently and freely to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit her, and there we contrive our petty deſignes, and no body e're the wiſer. I would deſire but as many thouſand Crownes as I have gone thither times with young Sparks that injoyed her, while he that was her Maſter and Servant both together, thought ſhe could not open the Lock where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he carryed the Key.</p>
            <p>It is a Naturall thing to grow weary and be cloy'd, eating alwayes of one ſort of Cates. <hi>Lauretta</hi> became at length leſſe lovely in
<hi>Alidan</hi>'s eye, yet he would not forſake her quite; but deſiring to retaſte his ordinary Diſhes when he liſted, without ſcandal, he reſolved to give her <hi>Valentine</hi> in Marriage, with ſome advantages, as a recompence for his former ſervices. <hi>Valentine</hi> and ſhe are ſince come to dwell in a Caſtle not farre hence, whither I am going to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent her the commendations of a gallant Exchequer man, who ſhall obtain more in one day, than <hi>Francion</hi> has done in three Moneths. In Faith and he deſerves it too, were it for no other reaſon than that he gave his affection birth, at a remarkable time, and upon a charitable account. The firſt time he ſaw <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta,</hi> was in the Church, when ſhe was married, and conſidering her Husband look'd not like a man that could give her what ſhe might deſire, he propoſed out of brotherly kindneſſe to lend him his aſſiſtance. Within ſhort time you will ſee him in this Countrey, for he is ſo confident I will acquit my ſelfe well of the charge I have taken upon me, that I believe he is come out of <hi>Paris</hi> already.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">Are you ſatisfied now
<hi>Francion?</hi> there's all I can tell you of your Miſtreſſe: Doe you love her ſtill as fervently as you did?</q>

Ha! <hi>Francion</hi> my friend (replied <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi>) I have told you ſufficiently what power Money has over the Spirit of <hi>Lauretta:</hi> I cannot deny that, but ſhe's a Woman (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) and not inſenſible of the communicative pleaſures with a perſon whoſe merit is agreeable. It may be in hopes to finger good ſtore of Ducats, ſhe may proſtitute her Body to the deſires of ſuch a ſilly Coxcomb: but ſhe will never bend the inclinations of her mind to love <pb n="50" facs="tcp:59287:32"/>him, and when ſhe ſees his Purſe empty, ſhe'l empty her thoughts of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſhe made him believe ſhe bare him.

            <p>This diſcourſe ended, <hi>Agatha</hi> took leave of the Company, and ſetling her ſelf again in the Cart, ſhe advanced towards her Niece's dwelling-place, with whom ſhe had no deſire to treat in that manner as ſhe had threatned <hi>Francion:</hi> for ſhe reſolved to make his game ſure with <hi>Lauretta,</hi> without letting him know it, and give the Lawyer the Lurch.</p>

Their life is interwoven with continuall Miſeries, nevertheleſſe their inſenſibility robbs them of Remords, and fils their vaine hearts with joy; yet 'tis but a falſe one, a meere ſhadow of delight, and farre different from that reall hearts-eaſe attends thoſe that live uprightly. We have here ſeen <hi>Agatha</hi>'s deportments, and heard her ſpeak in termes very diſſolute; But the nature of the <hi>Comedie</hi> requires thoſe expreſſions, rightly to repreſent the part ſhe was to perſonate, yet that's not capable to make us wrie our Soules to the deſire or practiſe of Vice; quite contrary it renders Vice more hatefull, to ſee it ſo lively pourtraid in its true colour.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S this pernicious old Hagg bade adieu, leaving thoſe had heard her diſcourſe much ſatisfied with her facetious ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, into the Inne came a Coach, which the Gentleman, who had laine with <hi>Francion,</hi> ſent for to his own houſe in the morning betimes: And after dinner, ſeeing the Rain was paſt, he ceaſed not importuning the Pilgrim, till he conſented to take place in the Coach, telling him he was big with deſire to be honor'd with his companie at his houſe, where he might be confident to finde as good entertainment as he could expect in the unknowne Village whither he intended to goe. <hi>I muſt acknowledge my ſelfe exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devable to Fortunes kindneſſe (continued he) for addreſsing me into the company of a man whoſe acquaintance I ſhall be proud to purchaſe.

                  </gap> no further teſtimony of his Gratitude, than that he would pleaſe to recount him the Dreame had entertained his fancy the night before.</hi> So, overcome with Courteſie, as the Coach trundled along the pleaſant Plaines, <hi>Francion</hi> thus began:</p>
            <p>Sir, <hi>Since your ingenuous spirit deſires to be recreated with the Chimerical fancies of a troubled Brain, I will tell you the moſt Extravagant you ever yet have heard, impoſing, on my owne accord, this Law upon my Lips, that if any impertinences they let fall, diſreliſh you, I ſhall cloſe them with the Seale of Silence, as ſoon as you pleaſe to diſcover your diſlike. You ſhould never make an end</hi> (ſaid the Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundian Gentleman, interrupting him) <hi>if you would continue ſpeaking till I bid you ceaſe; for you can ſay nothing, but what is extreamely to the purpoſe, and <pb n="52" facs="tcp:59287:33"/>will create ſingular ſatisfaction in the hearers: And though what you dreamt, may be void of Reaſon, and without Order, yet I will lend you my beſt attention, that I may the better track your fancy, and pick out ſome ſignification. I ſhall hold you no longer in expectation of the contentment you ſo much deſire</hi> (replyed the Pilgrim) <hi>though I am confident</hi>] Artimidorus <hi>himſelf would want a thred to lead him out of this</hi> Labyrinth.</p>
            <p>After I had ended my Story, and bid you good-night, I ſuffered my fancy to ſtray after an infinity of ſeverall thoughts; I fell a building rare Deſigns, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching my Love and Fortune (the two Tyrants that proſecute my life) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus buſied, I was, unawares, ſurprized by ſleep.</p>
            <p>I firſt fancied my ſelf in a ſolitary Plain, where I found an old man that had large Ears, and his Mouth ſhut up with a Padlock, to open which, it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, till the Letters, that ſerve to compoſe theſe words, <hi>IT IS TIME,</hi> were aſſembled at the key-hole.</p>
            <p>Perceiving the uſe of Speech was forbidden him, I demanded the reaſon of his Tongue's reſtraint, thinking he would have anſwered by Signs, but, placing certain hollow Horns to his Ears, the better to receive my Voice, he pointed with his hand to a little Wood, as if the dumb language of his geſture had ſent my Curioſiry thither for ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>When I had made my approaches ſomething near, I heard a confuſed prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling noiſe, that did but unpleaſantly mend the old mans defect. In the midſt of many others, there were ſix Trees, which (inſtead of leaves) had ſlender Tongues tyed to their Branches, with ſo looſe a thred, as every blaſt of wind (which then was ſomewhat boyſtrous) ſtill knock'd them one againſt another: This Concuſſion made them break into a Chat ſo loud, as I might over-hear them brawl confuſedly, and exchange their ſpight in moſt reproachfull tearms. The Conteſt had not continued long, before a mighty Giant, that was laid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhade, ſuſpecting they would reveal ſomewhat he deſired to keep ever ſecret, unſheath'd his <hi>Cimiter,</hi> and gave his Arm no reſpite till he had beaten them down, and cut them all in pieces; yet they retained ſtill ſo much of life, as made them often leap from the ground, and indeavour to continue their injurious Prattle. But his Fury ſoon found a greater cauſe of increaſe; for paſſing ſomething farther, he ſpied me leaning againſt a Rock, where he knew I might read an ample relation of his whole life's vicious behaviour. This provoked his haſty approach to hack that witneſs of his crimes, in pieces; but, perceiving the obdurate Stone (without confeſſing the leaſt Dint) at every blow, ſend his jarring Blade back to his Head; his Rage was wound up to that height, as immediately he kill'd himſelf with his own Weapon; and ſuch an intolerable ſtink proceeded from his body, that it forc'd me to retreat as far back as I could to avoid it. After this (methought) I was in Heaven; how I came there I know not, for you know how ill the Method of Reaſon is obſerv'd in Dreames: And now you ſhall hear the moſt fantaſtick imaginations that ever crept into a Brain, but I muſt deſire you to forbear laughing, leſt I ſhould bear you company, and then my Head (which I feel yet very fore) muſt ſuffer for it.</p>
            <p>Forward (good Sir) ſaid the Gentleman, I take too much pleaſure in this Relation to endure delay, and for Laughter, my Teeth ſhall impriſon it: But well, you were in Heaven (you ſay) and how contriv'd, was it handſom? A very handſom queſtion (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) could it be otherwiſe, being the Seat of Glory, and Fountain of the moſt Radiant Beauties?</p>
            <p>Methought the Starres (the better to illuminate thoſe Vaults) ſhin'd as well under, as above me, and were all faſtned to their Orbs with golden Buckles: After I had pleaſed my eyes a while with the contemplation of theſe Mervailes, I ſpied a company of beautifull <hi>Ladies</hi> (which I took for <hi>Goddeſſes</hi>) that came and unbuckled every one her Starre, and faſtned it to the end of a Silver Wand, <pb n="53" facs="tcp:59287:33"/>to light them to the Sphere of the Moon; for the Sun's abſence (he being then in the other
<hi>Hemisphere</hi>) had made the way very dark. This made me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that the cauſe why the Starres ſometime ſeemed to ſhift their ſtation, came from this Cuſtome of diſplacing them.</p>
            <p>I made theſe goſſipping <hi>Goddeſſes</hi> my Guides, till one of them looking back, ſpy'd me, and ſhew'd me to the reſt of her Companions, who preſently made all towards me, and bade me welcome, with ſuch exceſs of complement, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented ſome ſhame to finde my ſelf ſo poſed in Courtſhip; But the celeſtiall Shrewes ſoon ſet a Date to their kind entertainment, and fell to conſider what rigorous puniſhment they ſhould inflict upon me: After a ſhort conſultation, the leaſt in the company began to ſwell to ſuch a prodigious bigneſs, that her Head ſaluted ths Roof of the next Heaven above her, and (to prove her Strength ſuitable to her Shape) ſhe gave me ſuch a fierce kick with her foot, as made me roul ſix times about the World in a moment,; for, the Plancher was ſo round and ſmooth, I ſtill glided away without ceaſing, but (as I ſuppoſe you know) there being neither Aſcent nor Deſcent, when I came to the Region of our <hi>Antipodes,</hi> I was no more revers'd than here.</p>
            <p>At laſt, lighting into the Concave of a ſtrake made by the Wheel of the Sun's Chariot, there my Courſe was ſtopp'd, and I might have lain long enough, had I not been help'd up by the fellow that look'd to his Horſes, who, after a little conference, told me he had formerly been a Groom in the King's Stable, which made me foſter a conceit, that after Death Men follow'd the ſame Profeſſion in the other World, as they profeſſed on Earth. Growing familiar with him, I deſired he would ſhew me the moſt remarkable Singularities the place affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: Eaſily conſenting to my demand, he led me immediately to a great Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall Baſon, wherein diſcerning a kind of white Liquor, not much unlike Soap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuds, I ask'd him what that ſignified? he anſwer'd, it was the matter whereof mine, and all other Humane Souls were formed: This was continually haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a number of little winged Boyes, no bigger than a Finger, that hover'd over till they had dipp'd a ſtraw into it, and then ſlew I know not whither. My Conductor (being wiſer than I ſuſpected him) informed me, that they were the
<hi>Genyes</hi> of Mankind, who, with their little Pipes, gadded to and fro, to infuſe Soules into the Wombs of ſleeping Women eighteen dayes after their Conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and the more they injected of that Matter, the better the Infant (whoſe Birth they took care of) was furniſhed with Judgement and Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
            <p>I demanded then why the Diſpoſitions of Men were ſo various, ſince their Souls were all made of the ſame Materialls. You muſt know (reply'd he) this Compoſition is the Excrement of the Gods, who are ſtill wrangling among themſelves; and this Subſtance, which proceeds from their Bodies, imitates their contentious inclinations, as appears by the continuall agitation of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, which perpetually fumes and foams into an angry Froath, as if ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Wind within were fomenting the War: Beſides, the Souls, when dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into humane Members, are ſtill at diſcord, becauſe the Organs, by which they act, are of ſuch different conſtitutions, one overflowes with Flegm, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oppreſt with Melancholly, in this Choller Tyrannizes, in that Blood Predominates, and ſo from the oppoſition of humors, it is eaſie to collect effects as contrary.</p>
            <p>See what rare Reaſons (ſaid I) hath this fellow found out for humane diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions; But, Sirrah, you ſay the Gods are quarrelſome; you lie, and take that for your ſaucy Blaſphemy; with that I reach'd him a good box on the ear, but the ſtout Knave repaid me ſo rudely, that he fell'd me to the bottom of the Baſon, where, before I could recover my ſelf, I ſwallow'd (I believe) above 50000 Souls: Therefore now ſure I ought to be taken for a Man of notable ſpirit and courage. Methought this Drink had a kind of a ſweet taſte, like Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <pb n="54" facs="tcp:59287:34"/>Milk, yet it could not properly be called a liquor, but rather a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted Miſt or ſpiſcious Froath; for being with no ſmall paine got out againe, I found it had not ſo much as moiſtned my Cloaths.</p>
            <p>My curioſity not yet ſatisfied, I went on in queſt of ſome more novelties, and after a little wandring I perceived divers perſons, ſome drawing at a great Cord, and ſome repoſing themſelves, being newly come from the ſame exerciſe, which I judg'd was very toileſome by the large drops of ſweat I ſaw trickling from their fore-heads:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">What are theſe? What is't they doe? ſaid I to a man clad like an Hermit, that ſtood by looking on; Theſe are the Gods (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he very civilly) that buſie themſelves in keeping the Spheare of the world in its ordinary Motion, you ſhall preſently ſee thoſe others that now are reſting themſelves, returne to the reliefe of theſe that labour; But how doe they turne the Spheare? quoth I. Did you never ſee a Wall-nut (reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he) pierc'd through and a ſtick put into it, which being drawne by a thred, turn'd a little Mill at the end of it? Very oft, ſaid I, for when I was a Boy it was my ordinary Paſtime: You will eaſily then conceive this Miſterie (anſwer'd he) if you doe but fancy the Earth (which is ſtable) to be ſuch a Nut, for it is peirc'd through with that long Travers call'd the <hi>Axletree</hi> that reaches from <hi>Pole</hi> to
<hi>Pole.</hi> To the middle of which, this Cord is faſtned, in in ſuch a manner, as by drawing it the firſt Heaven is turned round, and having Pullyes in certaine Holes that directly anſwer one another, the next is likewiſe turn'd (but more ſwiftly) and ſo the motion is deriv'd to all the reſt in order. But walke a little further this way and I will ſhew you another ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I preſently turn'd my ſteps as he directed, and guiding my eyes to that part of the Heavens his finger pointed at (which was very tranſparent,) I ſpy'd a company of women that ſeem'd to play with the
<hi>Circles,</hi> and (ſtriking them with their hands) made them turne about like Whirligigs.</p>
            <p>Then, me thought I had a deſire to returne to the Earth, and intreating the Hermit to inſtruct me in the way, he bade me lay hold with both my hands on the Cord the Gods were drawing at, by which I ſlipt without much trouble downe, till I came to the entrance of that wide Opening, where it paſs'd through, and then to eſcape the <hi>Precipice</hi> (I cannot relate the manner) but the Aire (me thought) bare me up, and I hover'd in it, as if my Armes had been Wings; This new faſhion'd Dance between Heaven and Earth much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted me for a while, but at laſt I grew weary of that exerciſe; and finding my ſelfe neare two little Ditches full of water, I perceived two naked young men bathing, and often vaunting of the delicate pleaſures all their Members taſted to the very Throat in that liquid Chriſtall: This ſet me a longing to take my ſhare in the happineſſe they bragg'd of, ſo I nimbly ſtrip'd off all my Cloaths, and ſpying a Ditch, whoſe waters ſeem'd of a cleerer complexion than the reſt, I choſe that for my Bath; But as ſoone as I had ſtept into it, I found my ſelfe fallen downe a <hi>Precipice,</hi> for it was onely a broad piece of Glaſſe, which breaking with my weight almoſt flay'd my leggs with the broken edges.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Fortune</hi> ſo kindly contriv'd the fall, that I was not bruiſ'd; The bottome was all covered with the tender Breſts of young women, glew'd together two by two, like pretty ſoft Foot-bals, upon which I gently rowl'd my ſelf fancying much delight in my misfortune: But at laſt tir'd with the continuance of the ſport, and laſtly repoſing my ſelfe on my back, a handſome Lady approaches me with a Bottle in her hand, kneels down by me, and puts a Tunnel in my Mouth, ſaying, She would give me a taſte of the moſt delicious Liquor I had ever drunk. This made me prepare to receive it with a wider throat than the ſinging-man that ſwallowed a drown'd mouſe in his Mornings draught, when ſhe raiſing her ſelfe a little, in ſtead of making my Mouth water, made water <pb n="55" facs="tcp:59287:34"/>in my Month, to the quantity of at leaſt a Pinte, S. <hi>Dennis</hi> meaſure, and it was all run down my Throat, before I could diſtinguiſh the taſte of her Bounty. But Deſire to revenge this immodeſt injury, ſet me quickly upon my leggs, and the payment of a ſingle box o'th' Eare for my Beverage, ſhatter'd her Body all to pieces: Here lay her Head, there her Arms, a little farther her Thighs, in ſhort, all her Members were divided and ſcatter'd one from another; But, which moſt amazed me, every part, notwithſtanding the Diſſolution, buſied it ſelfe in the ſunction of its uſuall office, The Leggs walked about the Cave, the Armes ſtruck at me, the Mouth grinn'd, and the Tongue reviled me.</p>
            <p>The Feare I apprehended to incurre Danger for this Woman's Death, made me ſtrain my invention to recover her; a ſtrong conceit poſſeſſed me, that if all the Parts were reunited, ſhe would return to her former eſtate, ſince none had yet forgot to exerciſe its proper function: and having thus put her toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againe (like a Clock that had been taken in pieces) her Armes and Head onely excepted, methought her Belly look'd ſo inticingly, that I began to be in the humour to ſport with it, and tender her an amorous Redreſſe for ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my former Rudeneſſe, when her Tongue cry'd out, I had miſtaken her Breaſts, and put others (which my haſt had gather'd up in the Cave) in the room of hers. This ſet me a ſeeking for the right ones, (which found) I had no ſooner put them in their places, but the Head and the Arms came of their own accords, to recompleat the whole, and take their ſhare in the delight with the reſt of the Members; the Mouth kiſs'd, and the Arms hugg'd me with cloſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, till wearied into a pleaſing languiſhment, I chang'd the Recreation into Reſt.</p>
            <p>Then the Lady made me riſe, and (through an Advenue that conveyed the light into the Cavern) led me by the hand into a ſpacious Hall, the walls of which were hvng about with wanton Pictures, that repreſented the ſoft ſports of Love in many vary'd poſtures. I had not long entertain'd my eyes with the contemplation of theſe inanimate Pieces, but from the next Chamber, there ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out a ſcore of handſome Laſſes, with their haire dancing in looſe curls about their naked bodies, and came all frisking towards me, beating the Switzers march upon their buttocks; and after ſome pretty freaks, ſurrounding me, they fell to tabour mine to the ſame tune, till my patience giving way, I try'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite their Muſick upon their own Inſtruments: But at length feeling my ſelfe too weak to maintaine this ſportive quarrell, I made a flat retreat into a Cloſet I found open, the floore of which was ſtrewed with Roſes, halfe a yard thick: Thither the wanton Conquerants purſued me, and there we rowl'd one over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother after a mad faſhion, till, I believe, we were all alike willing to give the Game over. At laſt, they buryed me over head and eares in the flowers, where wanting the benefit of Aire, I ſtrove as faſt as I could to recover my feet, but ere I could riſe out of my fragrant Sepulchre, my joviall fellow-tumblers were all vaniſht. And as I paſt out of the Roſe-bed, through the great Hall, in queſt of my bonny Laſſes, I met with an old Woman like <hi>Agatha,</hi> who begg'd a kiſs of me with this pretty invitation, <hi>that ſhe was much handſomer than thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent queans I ſought for:</hi> But I (that could finde no inticement in ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit Deformity) gave her a rude repulſe; and as I had advanced a few ſteps from her, <hi>Well Francion,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>You will repent this Deniall, and ſhortly ſue in vaine for what you now ſo uncivilly reject.</hi> Theſe words invited my ſtragling looks back again to her, and then to my grand amazement, I perceived ſhe was not an old Woman (as I firſt fancied) but the faire <hi>Lauretta,</hi> that had coſt me ſo many ſighs.
<hi>Pardon me, Deare Miſtreſſe,</hi> cry'd I immediately, <hi>and let your ſodaine transformation beare the blame of my diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>respect.</hi> This ſaid, I offer'd to embrace her, but ſhe preſently vaniſh'd, and left me nothing but an arm-full of Aire: then the noiſe of a loud laughter directed my eye to the place whence
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59287:35"/>it came, where I ſpy'd all my naked Troop of Play-fellowes mocking at the Adventure had befallen me, and among other things they ſaid, <hi>in ſtead of</hi> Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta <hi>I muſt make ſhift with one of them.</hi> Content (cry'd I) let any one of you (that can entertaine me with a Maiden-head) come ſee what ſport I'le ſhew her upon the Roſe-bed; at that they fell a laughing ten times louder, and ſo confounded me with their Clatter, that I was jeer'd quite out of countenance; At laſt the Youngeſt in the company began to pitty me, and coming neerer, told me, if I would goe along with the company, ſhe would ſhew me all their Maiden-heads.</p>
            <p>I followed her, and ere we had gone farre, She conducted me into a little Temple, upon the Altar of which, I ſaw the Image of the God of
<hi>Love</hi> invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron'd with abundance of ſmall Viall-glaſſes, fill'd with a kinde of ſubſtance that could not properly be call'd Liquor; It was of a Vermilian colour like blood, onely in ſome places there was a mixture of white ſtreakes like milke. <hi>See,</hi> (quoth ſhe) <hi>theſe are Womens Maiden-heads, and thoſe, we might once call ours, are here among them; as ſoon as they are loſt, they are brought to the Altar of this Deity, who eſteems them above all other Offerings: By the Scrowles upon them, you may know their Names to whom they once belong'd, and what the Men were that got them. Pray ſhew me</hi> Lauretta<hi>'s</hi> (ſaid I to her) <hi>Look</hi> Francion (anſwered ſhe, bringing me one of the Glaſſes in her hand)
<hi>this is her's, you may know it by her name written on it: But I ſee not the Champions name</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>that had the first happineſſe to ſtruggle for it. You muſt know</hi> (reply'd my faire Directreſſe)
<hi>when a Maiden-head is reſign'd before Marriage, the name of him that had it is never recorded, nor is it fit ſuch failings ſhould be revealed; For the uncontrouled force of Vigorous Nature does oft provoke us to ſurrender the Fort at the firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, ſometimes perhaps to an unworthy Perſon, and then the diſcovery of his Name would ſhame us. From this you may conclude, that ſo ſoon as your</hi> Lauretta <hi>perceiv'd her Virgin-bud to diſcloſe, ſhe ſuffer'd it very providently to be cropt, knowing Delay would but blow it broader, and the longer ſhe ſuffer'd it to grow, the more it haſted to a fading, and the leſſe the pleaſure would be at the gathering.</hi> After this whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Diſcourſe, ſhe led me into an adjoyning Temple, where upon a high Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar was raiſed the Statue of
<hi>Vulcan,</hi> with a paire of goodly Hornes on his head, at leaſt ſeven foot in height, and the Walls were all hung round with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the ſame kinde. <hi>Sure this is ſome Hunter</hi> (ſaid I to my Guide) <hi>that has hung up theſe horned Trophies in memory of his sportive Conqueſt in the Woods; No, no,</hi> quoth ſhe, <hi>theſe are the badges of Cuckoldry, which men carry inviſibly about them;</hi> Preſently from an obſcure corner of the Temple comes out <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> clad like a Chimney-Sweeper, and his Fore-head branch'd with a paire of Silver Hornes. <hi>Thou art not indebted to me for theſe precious ornaments</hi> (ſaid I to my ſelfe) <hi>but thou ſhouldſt have been, could I as eaſily have done it as deſired it.</hi> Then ſome of the Laſſes that follow'd us, took occaſion to make themſelves merry with the faire Crop that grew upon his fore-head, and continued to deride him with ſuch broad abuſes as forc'd him to give way to their Mirth, and ſo was hiſs'd out of the companie. When he had left the Room, they told me his Argent Hornes ſignified, that his wife help'd him to a profitable Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and I might ſee ſome there deck'd with pretious Stones, but thoſe that were ſimply of Wood, belong'd to ſuch blinde Wretches as were Cuckolds, but knew it not, and gain'd nothing by their Wives Levitie, beſides the bare Diſgrace.</p>
            <p>Having offered up a ſhort Prayer to the God <hi>Vulcan,</hi> that he would permit I might plant ſtore of thoſe Branches in others Soles, but never ſuffer them to take Root in mine owne, I returned to the Temple of
<hi>Love,</hi> whom with meet Devotion I beſought, he would vouchſafe to indue me with the Art and Power to crop as many <hi>Virgin-flowers,</hi> as would ſerve to cover his whole Altar. Theſe Ceremonies paſt, I returned very jocund to the Ladies Hall, but at the door I <pb n="57" facs="tcp:59287:35"/>was incounter'd by <hi>Valentine,</hi> who charg'd me with his Antlers ſo boyſterouſly, that he deeply wounded me in the Belly; This made me retire to the Roſie Cabinet, where lying downe, I began to ſurvey my Bowels, and peruſe all that was moſt ſecret about them: I drew them out at full length, and had the curioſity to meaſure them with my hand, but I cannot remember how many ſpannes they were long: 'twere a hard task to relate the humour I was then in, for (though I found my ſelf deeply wounded) yet, methought, I was neither diſmaid at the Danger, nor very deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I had not laine long in this Pickle, when the Woman that piſſed in my mouth, came with a Needle and Thred, and ſewed up the Orifice ſo neatly, as there remain'd not the leaſt appearance of a Scarre: This done, ſhe invited me to her Cavern, with a promiſe to ſhew me <hi>Lauretta:</hi> When we were come below, perceiving <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta</hi> ſtand up in a corner without any motion, Paſſion made me run eagerly to imbrace her, but (inſtead of being entertain'd with delicate ſoft fleſh) I felt nothing but a could Stone, which made me imagine it was onely her Statue, and not ſhe: Yet I obſerved her eyes rowle to and fro, as if they had imployed their owne lively Glances; and her Mouth, after the Prologue of a pleaſing ſmile, gave me theſe words, <hi>My deare</hi> Francion, <hi>welcome, my Anger is now o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verblowne, and I have here long waited for your Coming.</hi> The woman that conducted me, perceiving me ſomewhat perplex'd, told me I did but caſt away my imbraces, for <hi>Lauretta</hi> was inclos'd in a caſe of Glaſſe fitted to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Body, which I might eaſily diſcover, if I look'd but a croſſe upon it. Then ſhe fell to diſcourſe of <hi>Valentine,</hi> and would needs perſwade me that I was as feeble and inſufficient as he to performe a charge in <hi>Love's</hi> combate, but withall, told me ſhe would apply Remedies to reſtore my vigour: (for you know in Dreames the fancy commonly is moſt buſied in repeating the paſſages of the precedent day.) In ſumme, ſhe made me lye downe at my full length, and thruſt a long ſlender ſtick ſo farre into my Fundament, that it appear'd above the Crowne of my head; yet I was ſo farre from feeling the leaſt paine, that I was more ready to break out into laughter than complaint; and all I ſuffer'd by its paſſing through me, was onely a tickling kinde of delight it left in thoſe parts it pierc'd: At length guiding my hand to that part of the ſtick that came out at the top of my Head, I found it began to put out with little Branches full of leaves, and a little after appear'd the Bud of an unknowne Flower, which beginning to open, by degrees ſpred it ſelfe wide enough to entertaine my eye with the delight of its delicate colour. Curioſity made me long to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſmell was as gratefull to the Noſe, as the beauty to the eye; but not being able to carry my Noſe to that, I reſolv'd to bring it to my Noſe: to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie my ſence I nip'd the ſtalk aſunder, but was ſtrangely amaz'd when I ſaw bloud drop from the parts my Nailes had wounded. Preſently after I began to be ſenſible of a little paine, of which when I had acquainted my Chyrurgion, ſhe came running to me, and ſeeing what I had done cry'd out, <hi>your owne raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe has ruin'd you, Alas! the flower you have gather'd was one one of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of your Bodie, you muſt periſh immediately; But I know (replyed I) it is in your power to reſtore me, for you have given a pregnant proof that nothing is too hard for your Skill. Well</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>He doe my beſt to cure you, and ſince</hi> Lauretta <hi>is here too, I despair not by her meanes to ſucceed well in my enterpriſe.</hi> This ſaid, ſhe opened that part of the Glaſſe-caſe which was oppoſite to <hi>Lauretta</hi>'s Mouth, bidding her blow into a long hollow Cane, the further end of which ſhe had put into a little hole in the ground, made on purpoſe; then having pull'd the ſtick out of my body, ſhe plac'd my back-part over a hollow paſſage, that directly anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lower end of the Cane; <hi>Now blow</hi> (<hi>ſaid ſhe to</hi> Lauretta) <hi>with all your might, for it is your breathing this way muſt reſtore your dying Servants spirits, though other Ladies uſe to apply, and receive ſuch Cordials from their Lovers, by fervent kiſſes at the other end.</hi>

               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:59287:36"/>Then, methought, I felt a ſweet breath gently ſteale in at my poſterne gate, which gave me a moſt incredible delight; by degrees it increaſed, and at length became ſo vehement, that it lifted me from the Earth to the Roof of the Vault: afterwards, by little and little, it began to moderate its violence, and in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by a gentle kinde of hovering deſcent, ſet me downe againe: then turning my head toward
<hi>Lauretta,</hi> I perceived ſhe had broken her Glaſſe priſon in two pieces, and looking very blithe, came dancing towards me; I being firme upon my feet (for ſhe had left blowing in the Pipe, that made me caper in the Aire) and forgetting the foregoing paſſages, an eager Love-fit made me ope my Armes with intent even to bruiſe her with my imbraces: But at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant you waked me, and made me ſee what an Armfull of ugly Wrinkles I had got, inſtead of my faire Miſtreſſe. When I conſider what delicate ſport you ſpoil'd, which I was taſting in <hi>Idea,</hi> I can give it no better title than an injury; but then weighing again how you reſcu'd my body from polution, with a thing I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think on without horror, I find my Obligation too big for my Expreſſion, the Pleaſure had onely diſſembled with my Fancy, but the Miſchief would have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſted the Dream, therefore I conclude my ſelf your deep Detor for the Courteſie.</p>

And if you would know the meaning of your Heavenly Adventurers, they may ſerve to deride the ſublime folly of pretenders to Aſtrologie, and mock at the repute, they would have the World aſcribe to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine Science. The Glaſſe that broke when you fell into the Cave, ſhewes the inſtability of Worldly pleaſures. The Womans piſſing in your Mouth ſignifies, that the deare delight we fancy in the wanton exploit with Women, is but Excrement and Ordure; And the Blow that ſtruck her into ſo many Pieces may let you underſtand the ſraile conſtitution of Womens Love, which is ſo prone to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and (upon every ſlight occaſion) ready to crack into inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: That the Head and Arms would not loſe their ſhare in the pleaſure with the reſt of the Members, ſhadowes their Vaine Pride, that would not onely be ador'd for what is handſome about them, but what their partiall Miſtake apprehends to be ſo, though it be not.

            <p>What Diſcourſe ſoever paſs'd betwixt them hereupon, for my owne part I conclude with this opinion, that whoſoever ſuffer themſelves to be carryed downe the ſtreame of Mundane Vanities, their Thoughts muſt continually fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the motion of their Hearts, and their ſleep can ne're be quiet; Or I may rather ſay, they ſleep and dreame alwaies, for what e're they ſee is but Illuſion and Fallacy; in ſo much, though
<hi>Francion</hi> ſeemed to diſtinguiſh the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walkes of his Fancy from the reſt of his life's adventures, I eſteem them parallel, and believe his Actions were not much more regular: However (as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon errour of diſtempered People, is to believe they are not diſtempered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he made the recitall of his Dreame, he imagined himſelfe awake, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion thought no leſſe: For they, whoſe Braines are diſeaſed, and deluded with the Fantaſies of this World, are not capable of knowing the abuſe.</p>
            <p>Divers ingenious and agreeable flouriſhes and conceipts that took their riſe from ſome Paſſages of the Dreame, were hadſomely interchang'd betwixt our <pb n="60" facs="tcp:59287:37"/>fellow-travellers, till at laſt they arrived at a faire Caſtle, that belong'd to the Burgundian Gentleman, the plaiſance of whoſe Seat, with the ſtately Structure, curious Contrivance, ſumptuous furniture, and multitude of Attendance that paid him great reſpect at his entrance, ſpeak him of more eminent quality than

            <p>After Supper the Gentleman conducted <hi>Francion</hi> into a goodly Chamber, preſſing him to goe to Bed preſently, becauſe he had need of Reſt, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the wound in his Head to be unbound, and the Plaſters his Countrey Chirurgion had applyed, to be taken off, he dreſs'd it with a certaine exquiſite Balme was brought out of <hi>Turkie,</hi> that had the vertue in very ſhort ſpace to cure all ſorts of Wounds.

<hi>Francion</hi> entertain'd him with this following ſtory.</p>
            <p>Since you are pleas'd to be ſo laviſh of your time, as to waſte it in hearing my Diſcourſe, I thinke it not improper firſt to give you an account of my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction; My Fathers name was <hi>La Porta,</hi> his Native Countrey <hi>Bretanit,</hi> hit deſcent is ſufficiently knowne to be from the nobleſt and moſt antient Families of that Province, his Vertues and Perſonall Valour were ſo ſignall, that (though, by the negligence and faithfull Tradition of the Pen-men of that age, he be not Chronicled in the Hiſtory of <hi>France</hi>) 'tis not unknowne who he was, and his name lives yet freſh in the memories of the moſt conſiderable Perſons, for ſeverall generous exploits performed, as well in open Battailes, for the ſervice of his Prince, as in private Incounters. After he had worne out the beſt part of his Age, in expectation of Advancement, by the ſupport of ſome <hi>Grandees,</hi> finding Fortune partiall in the diſpenſation of her Favours, and not inclining to anſwer his Merit, he left the Court in a diſcontent, and retired into his owne Countrey, where he had a competent Eſtate in Lands, which then fell intirely into his owne hands by the deceaſe of his Mother: But ſhe, having married her ſelfe to a ſecond Husband after his Fathers Death, the ſurviving Succeſſor of her Bed, unwilling to relinquiſh the poſſeſſion of ſo good a Pawn, and being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inclin'd to Contention, detain'd a conſiderable part to better his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and maintaine a ſuite againſt my Father with his owne Money. In fine, the Plea was drawne up <hi>in forma,</hi> and ready to be brought to a hearing before the <hi>Bailiff</hi> of one of the Principall townes in our Province; Inſomuch, my Father (who had rather have been commanded to force a Towne by aſſault, than conſtrained to fee a Lawyer; or make uſe of his ſword in a ſingle Combat, than handle a Pen or Buckram Bag at the Hall) knew not of what Wood to make his ſhaft, nor how to comport himſelf in this conteſt; At length, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the ſtrange influence and Power Preſents have over the Viler ſort of Soules (ſuch as the Iniquity of theſe Times has ſeated in the higheſt places of Judicature) he reſolved to tempt <hi>Juſtice</hi> with ſomething worth acceptance, and knowing the Grand Bailiff's vanity, he conceived a Piece of rich Satin, to new Robe him, might prove ponderous enough to weigh downe the Scale: with
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59287:37"/>this Silken baite, he went to recommend his caſe to his Judge, who aſſur'd him he ſhould have Juſtice; But my Father, having left his Lacquay at the doore, took the Satin under his owne Arme, which the Judge obſerving, <hi>What have you there Sir?</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is that a Bug of writings there under your Arme? Have you any other piece to ſhew me? Yes Sir</hi> anſwered my Father, <hi>It is a Piece of Satin was given me by a Merchant, in lieu of a ſumme of Money due to me, and I take the boldneſſe to preſent it you, to refreſh your memory, and make you more willing to peruſe the Pieces I have delivered you concerning my Proceſſe, and I beg your pardon if it be not anſwerable to your Deſert.</hi> The Bailiffe putting on a ſevere Countenance, and gravely ſtroaking up his ſtarch'd Muſtachoes, <hi>How Sir,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>who doe you take me for? I that am a Judge Royall, whoſe Integrity is irreprovable, doe you thinke me a Man to be corrupted by a Bribe, or that your Preſent (as you call it) can oblige me to be e're a whit more carefull of your Cauſe? Doe not I know my owne duty thinke you, without ſuch Remembrancers? Go, Go, I have nothing to ſay to you, nor your Satin neither, though the purchaſing my Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice emptied my Coffers (I confeſſe) I will not however repleniſh them with Money ſo ill gotten, I ſhall content my ſelfe with Honour and Authority: Learn hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forwards not to tempt thoſe that are incorruptible, Did your Proctor give you this advice? were I ſo aſſured he had no more diſcretion, I ſhould forbid him coming to the Barre this Twelve-month, for he ought to underſtand better than you what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes my charge.</hi>

            <p>My Father ſeeming ſomewhat troubled at this check, and the perſonated choller, that painted it ſelfe in the Judges face, preſently put up the Satin again under his Cloake, and with a low Cap-Complement, took leave without ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one Word. The Miſtreſſe of the Houſe, who from an inner Chamber had heard all the difference, not willing to let ſuch Preyes eſcape her Chitches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his paſſage with a profound Courteſie accompanyed with theſe Words, <hi>You ſee Sir, my Husband is ſomething Cholerick, you took not the right courſe to make him a friend to your cauſe, give me your Satin, I will pacifie him well enough, and he ſhall accept your Preſent.</hi> My Father had already reſolved to convert it into a Suit for his owne wearing, though he ſeldome went in black, indeed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it as a Melancholy and undelightfull Colour, which ſuited with none but People he did not greatly affect, becauſe contrary to his Martiall diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
            <p>In ſumme, the Satin was delivered to Madam
<hi>Baily-veſſe;</hi> But her Husband not knowing ſhe had been ſo provident, in meane time ſtood watching at his Hall window, and ſeeing his Client goe through the Court, <hi>Doe you heare, doe you heare,</hi> Monſieur de la Porta (cry'd he aloud to my Father) <hi>you ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given this once, ſo I finde you no more tardy; you may leave what you would have given me even now, for I conſider it would be too much trouble for you to carry it home againe. I have given't your Wife already</hi> (anſwered my Father) and ſo went away directly to his Proctors, who was one of the beſt of the
<hi>Cabal:</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had heard the paſſages betwixt my Father and the Bailiffe, <hi>This is no wonder you tell me, Sir,</hi> anſwered he, <hi>Alas! you know not the dispoſition of the Man ſo well as I, He is no Catch-pole, but he will catch as many Pieces as he can, nothing comes amiſſe to his hands, and his houſe is like Hell, what e're you carry thither, you muſt not expect to bring it back againe. He ask'd you if I counſell d you to offer him that Preſent, becauſe he knowes there's none of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his humour, will give our Clients any ſuch Advice: You ſhould have given it his Wife at firſt, or rather emploied ſome other to preſent it her, the better to cover the corruption, and that he might ſtill preſerve the repute of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this Silken Baite, my Father loſt the Fiſh, and was not onely caſt in his Cauſe, but adjudg'd to pay all Charges, beſides the Judges Fees, which amounted high, for Monſieur <hi>Baily</hi> cared not for playing at ſmall <pb n="62" facs="tcp:59287:38"/>games; and the reaſon that incited him to pronounce that <hi>juſt</hi> ſentence, was this, The Adverſe party having intelligence from the Mercer that ſold the Satin, how it had been beſtowed, and fearing that fine preſent might prove prejudicial to his intereſt, went likewiſe before the Day of Hearing, to ſolicite Mr. Bailiff: But not daring to offer him any thing, knowing the cuſtome and humour of the Perſonage, he bethought himſelf of a gentile wile to obtaine his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and cloak the others corruption: So, obſerving a handſome Picture, as he walked in the Hall with his Judges Wife, he fell into high commendations of the rare workmanſhip, and wiſhed he knew where to purchaſe ſuch another Peice;
<q rend="inline margQuotes">This is at your ſervice (ſaid the Lady) if you are ſo taken with it, you may command it. I am infinitely engaged to your courteſie, anſwered he, But pray tell me what it coſt, for I am reſolved to give you to the full value. <hi>Truly Sir it coſt ſix Crownes.</hi> There's ſix and thirty for you, replyed he, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a purſe of money in her hand, the paines you took to buy it, and the trouble you will find in weaning your fancy from it, deſerves a no leſs ſumme.</q> The ſubtill Woman eaſily conjecturing why he gave her ſo great a price for her Picture, pleaded his Cauſe ſo cloſe, that overcome by her ſolicitation, her Husband pronounced ſentence in his favour.</p>
            <p>There's no baſe Action committed, though never ſo ſecretly, but by one Accident or other, is ſtill brought to light. This was publiſhed by a Servant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid the Bayliff turn'd away, after he had paid her with many heavie blowes, which ſo exaſperated the ſilly wenches rage, that whereſoever ſhe came, ſhe related this ſtory, and ſpake his praiſes in ſuch termes, as rendred him odious and ſubject to all Peoples cenſure.</p>
            <p>My Father diſtaſted at his ill ſucceſſe, went to communicate his caſe to a Counſellor in the Court of Parliament of our Province, deſiring to know if he might not appeale from the ſentence of that inferiour <hi>Juſtice-ſeller.</hi> The Lawyer, who was never accuſtomed to diſſwade any Client from contention, failed not to remember his own intereſts in this Occurrence, and incouraged my Father by divers reaſons to ſue out his Appeal. <hi>You that are a Gentleman (ſaid he) must ſhew you have ſome Spirit, and not ſuffer your ſelfe to be overcome eaſily: A Proceſſe is a kinde of a Combate, where the Palme is given to him that wins the Prize, as well as at the Olympick games. He that makes himſelf a Sheep (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Proverb) the Wolf will eat him: you muſt live in the Countrie among stubborn, churliſh people, that will be apt to wrangle and denie your due obſervance, or come off quit of their Rents, eſpecially if they ſee you once ſo tame as to ſuffer your ſelf to be led by the Noſe like a muzled Ox. Beſides, if you remove your Suit to our illuſtrious Court, you will finde incomparable Advantages; It will be a meanes to make you knowne to thoſe that never heard of you, and render your Name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall: For our Regiſters and Records are eternall Monuments, where your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie ſhall be preſerved to all Poſteritie, and your ſucceſſors that ſhall inherit the Eſtate you leave, ſeeing theſe authentique proofes of your endeavours to preſerve it, will magnifie your care, and ſolemnize continuall Anniverſaries to your Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. Theſe conſiderations ought to ſweeten your ſorrow, and make you not ſo much repine at a little tranſitorie trouble, that perchance may disguſt in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of your juſt Claime: In fine, by my Advice you ſhould not let your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie reſt, nor hearken to any compoſition, though he ſhould offer it, you need nothing but a definitive Sentence, and make you no doubt of obtaining one to your owne contentment, for your Cauſe has Reaſon and Equity to plead for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon he fell a turning over <hi>Bartolus</hi> and
<hi>Cujas,</hi> from head to feet, and cited Law-caſes of all ſorts, to prove my Fathers Right, who (good Man) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved all he ſaid, not conſidering he was then in a place where they underſtood nothing better than ſuppoſing of falſe titles, and never remember any reaſons, but ſuch as they know will pleaſe their Clients. To be ſhort, he was directed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59287:38"/>to a ſucking Proctor lately ſprung up, who, I am confident, had payed money for his reception (I know to whom) for there was no likelihood his practiſe or experience in affaires at the Courts of Judicature, could have purchaſed him the permiſſion to plead. Nevertheleſſe, he was not ſo ignorant, but he knew well enough how to increaſe his Talent, and indeed he was ſo good a Proctor, that he procured ſtill for himſelf, however his Clients far'd; My Father was like to ſucceed well in mean time. This Fellow, to make his profit double, ſuffer'd himſelf to be gain'd by the Adverſe party, ſo played his game with both hands, and inſtead of advancing my Father's buſineſſe, retarded it, maugre all his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſolicitations, making him believe all the needleſſe Demurres he made, were neceſſary, and not to be avoided. All his diſcourſe was ſtill <hi>Monie, Monie,</hi> which he affirmed he muſt have for ſeverall fees, and other charges, though there was no occaſion of disburſing any thing: yet my Father refuſed not to furniſh him as oft as he deſired, on purpoſe to induce him to make more Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in his Buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, the Counſellor drew up I know not how many Writings, with two words in a line, that he might get the more: And to ſwell up the Number, his Clerk uſed a certain kinde of <hi>Cacographie,</hi> that admitted a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſuperfluous letters, you would have judged him a ſworn Enemy to thoſe that will have men write as they ſpeak, or fancy
<hi>Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gardiſmes,</hi> and ſpell <hi>com, hav.</hi> &amp;c. without <hi>e,</hi> and <hi>detor, dout</hi> without <hi>b.</hi> Beſides, he had ſuch a full Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter eech'd out with long Cloak-bag-ſtring daſhes, as ſometimes a whole Line will ſcarce containe two Words: But the Words were more to be excepted againſt than the Letters, for they ſignified no more than Ciphers, all was but frivolous diſcourſe, that had not the leaſt reference to the buſineſſe in agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This Counſellor had this pretty cuſtome among other commendable qualities, that if he had any thing to buy, he would be ſure to get by the firſt <hi>Bill</hi> or <hi>Replication</hi> came to his hands to be drawn, as much money as his occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions required; for he did uſually calculate before-hand how many ſheets would amount to ſuch a ſumme, which computed, he preſently reſolved to fill them, though but with old Ballades. My Father reflecting upon theſe Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, one day, as he was paying for ſome ſuch Writings, could not forbear ſaying,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">All he had done and ſcribled to that inſtant, availed not him a tittle, that he could have done as much himſelf, and perchance more, though he was not of the profeſſion; that it was but frivolous and unneceſſary babbling, to quote ſo many Caſes in Law, whereas he was certaine the Court never took notice of them.</q> This reproach awaked the Lawyers paſſion, and thinking his Honour highly intereſſed by this accuſation, he returned ſuch unhandſome language, as fomented their diſpute, and of a private Complaint began an open Quarrell: But my Father, the leſſe to provoke his Counſellor, by imputing all the kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of thoſe Gown-men to one particular perſon, made his Attaque gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and inveighed againſt the whole Tribe of Practitioners, from the Petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fogger to the Bencher, with ſuch expreſſions, as ſpake them little leſſe Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters than they are: <hi>What ſhame is this</hi> (ſaid he among other things) <hi>that theſe Villaines ſhould exerciſe their Robberies thus publiquely without puniſhment! They have found out a thouſand ſubtill tricks to cheat men of their Eſtates, they aggravate ſlight Treſpaſſes on purpoſe to foment Contention, and if any difference betwixt Partie and Partie grow to a Law-ſuit, they are all furniſhed with ſuch malices and ſhifts to protract the Cauſe, and cover their cunning Contrivances, that both Plantiff and Defendant ſhall returne home with loſſe, while they inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly convey the whole Profit into their owne Pockets. Can men be ſuch fooles to be dreyned by theſe Blood-ſuckers? Doe they not plainly perceive all theſe bundles of Bill and Anſwers are made meerely to deceive them? To what purpoſe ſerve all theſe unneceſſarie Procedures, but to render Cauſes more obſcure? Why doe they not proceed to ſentence as ſoone as the Parties have produced their Evidence? But <pb n="64" facs="tcp:59287:39"/>the worst in all theſe Jurisdictions is, there are ſo many different formes and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of proceeding; I would gladly know a reaſon why they ſhould not in all places uſe the beſt and ſhorteſt way to decide differences: yet what need of ſuch a queſtion?
'Tis palpable enough their Avarice invented theſe Demurres meerely to abuſe, and more covertly cheat thoſe who underſtand not their Pettifogging tricks. You are angrie for a ſlight matter</hi> (ſaid the Counſellour) <hi>and I dare ſay you complain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cauſe: Is there any thing the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe can boaſt of more admirable, than the manner of canvaſſing Cauſes in our Courts? Is it not a mark of the Grandeur of</hi> Juſtice <hi>to be attended by ſuch ſeverall Formalities, which like as many ſecret Springs ſerve each in their due Order to compleat the Frame, and give motion to that great Machine, which you Clients cannot obſerve without admiration and much contentment? As for the difference of Procedures in diſtinct Juriſdictions, it is rather to be commended than condemned; for doe not you know every Countrie muſt have its ſeverall Cuſtome? I will grant all you ſay to pleaſe you</hi> (anſwered my Father) <hi>but I am angrie that after all your triflings, and our patience, Juſtice is not rendred as it ought; if at length we could have but Right done us, there as no Delaies, no Formalities in your Proceedings, that we ſhould think inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon the Counſellor alledged divers things in juſtification of his honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable profeſsion, yet was conſtrained at laſt to acknowledge, much might be ſaid againſt it; but in concluſion, he gave this Reaſon, That the <hi>Divinity</hi> had ſent this Scourge among Mortals to puniſh the enormities of their Crimes. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeveral like Arguments, he was farther urged by my Father to confeſſe it was a generall Vulgar Errour, to call <hi>the perplexing of a Cauſe with Tricks,</hi> in one word, <hi>Practice,</hi> without diſtinguiſhing of what it is a
<hi>Practice,</hi> as if there were no other kind of <hi>Practice,</hi> or that this had gained ſo great a Prerogative over all others, as the onely naming that <hi>terme</hi> ſuffic'd to make any capacity comprehend what was meant.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Proceſſe, It was referred to the moſt fantaſticall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour of the whole pack. And it is remarkable, I know not by what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favour of the Starres, that ſort of people became half fooles by that time they arrive to thoſe grave years, as render other men more reſpected for their ſage Counſels and Deportments: All that ever hitherto frequented the ſupreme Courts, are ſtumbled at this obſervation, and the moſt probable reaſon can be given in my opinion, is, that for the moſt part they are fellowes of low, decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted Souls, deſcended from Parents of deſpicable extractions, and to keep their abſurd Gravity, they ſequeſter themſelves from all good Converſation, paſsing their time onely in ſuch ſtudies, as render them as much more ſtupid as they are more vile and ſordid than any other perſons the whole world af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords.</p>
            <p>My Father's Reporter, through his conſtant ſolitude, was become at length a perfect <hi>Miſanthropos,</hi> no body could boaſt of having any aſcendance over his Spirit; he was ſo Chymicall, neither party need feare, his compliance or partiality; the onely danger was, leſt he ſhould miſconſtrue, or not comprehend the Cauſe, for which he was more famous than for any other quality, except an impertinent Confidence, that flattered his vain credulity, no mans apprehenſion was ſo quick and ſolid as his own.</p>
            <p>The firſt time my Father went to ſee him, at a diſtance he took him for a Cryer of <hi>Funerals,</hi> and finding him ſtanding at his dore without any Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or Attendants, he was about to aske him, who was lately dead in that Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; But a young Man handſomely clad accoſting this ill-looking fellow with a low Reverence, made him correct his thoughts, and conſider he might be the Maſter of the Houſe, and before he made his Addreſſes, inquiring who that ſpruce Yonker was, he learn'd 'twas his Worſhips Clerk, who from a Groom had raiſed himſelfe to that degree, where he omitted not to uſe his fingers to <pb n="65" facs="tcp:59287:39"/>the beſt advantage, and curry Clients purſes, iuſtead of his Maſters horſes.</p>
            <p>The Councellor received this viſit without diſcovering any of the odd humors diſeas'd his braine, but at the next interview (my Father acquainting him with ſome particulars concerning his owne buſineſſe) he bid him hold his peade like an ignorant Pratler, that knew not what he ſaid, and ſend his Attorney who had more experience and Judgement to ſtate his Caſe.</p>
            <p>Not many dayes after, my Father returning to his houſe, the old Idiot ſpied his ſword, (I know not what fooliſh fancy fed his feares, but
'twas no leſſe cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall for any Gentleman to weare Weapons in his houſe than Spurres in the Palace) and as if ſome danger had required his ſpeedy oppoſition, he preſently ran to take downe an old ruſtie Halberd that hung in his hall, and brandiſhing it with his trembling hands, ſtood upon his guard at the top of the ſtone ſteps, as if he meant to ſtop the paſſage into the houſe. My Father deſiring to know the reaſon of this Antique Poſture, he anſwered, <hi>That ſeeing him come into his court with Armes, he knew not but his deſigne might be to take his houſe by Aſſault; and therefore he reſolved to ſtand upon his owne defence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was onely a laughing matter, but there ſucceeded other Paſſages that made my Father curſe the houre he ere began his Suit, and at length notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his Attorneyes perſwaſive arguments and advice, he went to viſit his Father-in-Law, offering to come to a comprimiſe, and the better to induce him to conſent, <hi>I beſeech you Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>let us ſpeedily withdraw from this Gulfe, whereinto we have imprudently caſt our ſelves, otherwiſe we ſhall be both ſwallowed up; for my owne particular, I had rather have to doe in</hi> Hell,
<hi>than at the</hi> Hall, <hi>rather endure any torture than the perplexities of Law and I believe the greateſt torment has been invented for the damned, is to ſow diſſention among them, and make them receive injuries, for which they ſhall never obtaine reparation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the paines and diligence can be uſed. Be confident when we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute our charges, neither of us ſhall finde much advantage againſt his Adverſary, nor any thing neerer the accompliſhing his deſigne; The whole Eſtate we contend for, will become a prey to this execrable Tribe of Villaines, who live onely upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers spoiles, and deſire no other occaſion of eſtabliſhing and enriching their owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, than the Ruine and impoveriſhing their Clients: Had not We better keep our Money, than ſling it away upon fellowes that ne're returne us thanks, but rather thinke us beholding ſtill to them, and for three lines of writing without Senſe, reckon us a ſumme beyond Reaſon? Let us divide betwixt us, what each coveted to preſerve intire for himſelfe, or I proteſt (I am ſo haraſt and diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Malices of theſe cheating Lawyers) rather than ſuffer my ſelfe any longer to be made a Prey to their inſatiable Avarice, I will reſigne my Intereſt, and give you peaceable poſſeſſion of the Whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This free propoſition arguing a generous Candour in my Father, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing much advantage to the adverſe Party, ſo won upon his humour, that (though before he would hearken to no Propoſalls of reconcilement) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed theſe Reaſons, and onely demanded ſome time for more ſerious delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Meane while happy chance preſenting (with ſome advantages) to my Father's unprepared eyes the Beauty of a Compleat Virgin, Daughter to his Step-Father, by a former Venter (who from her infancy had been bred at Penſion in a Religious Houſe) he ne're was ſatisfied with ſeeing her, this frequent look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begat an amorous liking, and liking ſoon grew up to ſuch fervent love, as he preſently reſolv'd to demand her in Marriage, which deſire crown'd with the Father's and her owne conſent, made a perfect Pacification, and concluded all differences by this Conjunction, to the ſorrow and ſhame of all their lawyers, who expected no ſuch Iſſue.</p>
            <p>Within one yeare after the ſolemnity of the Nuptialls, the Nocturnall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate toiles were recompenced with a publick joy by the Birth of a pretty Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, and about the Expiration of the like terme, ſucceeded a ſecond Fruit of <pb n="66" facs="tcp:59287:40"/>the ſame kinde; But five yeares were elapſed after their Marriage, before I had a Being; my firſt entrance into this World was remarkable, upon the ſame day the three <hi>Sage</hi> Kings followed the direction of the Star: For, my Mother, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been <hi>Queen</hi> of the <hi>Beane</hi> that Night, ſitting at the Tables end, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all her Subjects, felt ſome Throes that forced her to quit the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and repoſe upon a Bed, where ſhe was ſoon after delivered of me, without any other aſſiſtance than the <hi>Sage</hi> Matrons, <hi>Fortune</hi> had conducted thither, to divert their duller thoughts, and quicken <hi>Time</hi>'s ſlow pace with ſome joviall recreation.</p>
            <p>Thus I was borne <hi>Dolphin;</hi> but when I ſhall ſee the Royall Crowne upon my head, is beyond my knowledge; they dranke ſo many
<hi>full</hi> Carouſes to my health, as almoſt made all the Barrells in our Cellar <hi>empty:</hi> So, you muſt not thinke ſtrange if I am a deep Drinker now, for finding my ſelfe of a competent Age, and Conſtitution, I am reſolv'd <hi>now</hi> to anſwer proportionably all thoſe, that challeng'd me <hi>then</hi> to the Combat of the Cup, and I believe I ſhall beare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Palme.</p>
            <p>☞</p>
            <p>☞ To avoid prolixity, my Mother (as ſhe conceived) being not ſo well reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as to prove a Nurſe, delivered me unto a Farmers Wife, of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Village to be foſtered; nor doe I pretend to paſſe my verdict, whether or no ſhe did well to ſuffer me to ſuck any bodyes milke ſave her owne, for that in the firſt place, I am not ſo unnaturall a Son as to pry into her Actions, for that I'le aſſure you, it concernes me not at all, ſince I never ſucked from my Nurſe any humours which might be diſpleaſing unto Men of Wit and Courage; True it is, that I doe remember I was taught, as other children are, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fopperies invented by the Vulgar, inſtead of being brought up by degrees even from my youth, in high concernments, and being accuſtomed to ſpeak nothing, that might favour of lowneſſe or Baſeneſſe; but ſince that time (to my comfort be it ſpoken) I did accuſtome my ſelfe to that which was praiſe-worthy.</p>
            <p>And I muſt needs tell you (by the by) a pretty paſſage which happened unto me after I was weaned, and thus it was; I ſo exceſſively loved Pap, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came my daily food: Now as the Maide had ſet the Skillet over the Fire in my Chamber, whilſt that I was yet a bed, ſhe was called upon from out the Yard, and ſhe leaving her Skillet on the Hearth, went to know what was the matter; in the meane while a crafty Ape, which one of our neighbours had of late pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately kept, coming forth from under a Bed where be lay hid, and having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved (as you may imagine) how formerly the children were uſed to be fed with Pap; he ſeized upon the Skillet, and taking the Pap, all beſpattered my face therewith; after which, he brought me all my cloaths, and taking me up, he did put them me on after a new Mode, thruſting my Legs into my Coat ſleeves, and my Armes into my Stockins, nor can you believe but that I cryed to ſome tune, the uglineſſe of the Animall terrifying me not a little: But the Maid, who was otherwiſe buſied, came never the faſter for all that, My Father and Mother being gone to the Church; Finally, the Ape having thus perfected his Comedy, leaped out at the Widow upon the next Tree, and thence gained his Maſters houſe: The Maide returning a while after, and finding me in ſuch a Jack of Lent like poſture, wherein the Ape had left me, bleſſed her ſelfe a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times over and over, skreeking and rouling her eyes too and fro, being much aſtoniſhed; at length appeaſing me with blandiſhments, ſhe asked me who had thus tricked me up, and by reaſon I had formerly heard ſay that the Devill was ſome ugly thing, I told her that it was a little boy as illfavoured as the Devill, for I took the Ape who had a green Coat on, to be a boy. Nor was I ſo much miſtaken therein, as a Switzer, who meeting with an Ape at a Taverne doore, gave him a ſixe pence to change, and perceiving that in ſtead of the change which he expected, the Ape made mouths at him, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly <pb n="67" facs="tcp:59287:40"/>called on him, ſaying, ſpeak little Boy, wilt thou not returne me the change of my Moneys? whence it may be the proverb ſprang, which ſaith, making of Mouths, Friskings and Flouts, are the payment of Apes: but this <hi>Switzer</hi> was not couſened alone, for a Coridon being ſent with a basket of Peares to a Lord, at his coming into the houſe met with two great Apes on the top of the ſtaires, who immediately ſeizing on his basket, ſhared beſt part of the Fruits; now by reaſon the Apes had fine Coats on of cloath of Gold, and Daggers by their ſides, which rendered them very Worſhipfull Gentlemen to the Clownes thinking, he having never ſeen the like before, took off his Hat and made them a formall Leg; the Apes having ſufficiently ſtuffed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the Clown proceeded to make enquiry after the Lord, to whom making his preſent, the Maſter of the houſe asked him why he had not brought the basket full? the Coridon made anſwer, ſo it was Sir, but the little Gentlemen, your Sons, took the halfe of the Peares: and the jeſt was ſo much the better, for that the Lord was ſo ugly a Gentleman, as that a Coridon might well have ſuppoſed the Apes to have been his Off-ſpring: and whereby you may take notice, that ſince aged perſons did take ſuch creatures to be children, its no wonder I my ſelfe did ſo, being as then but a boy. But to returne to our Maid, who was in downe-right earneſt, conceiting with her ſelfe, that no children were come into our houſe, nor any ſtrange perſon whatſoever, ſhe really and firmely believed that ſome maligne ſpirits had played me this pranke, and after ſhe had unlooſed and well waſhed me, ſhe did caſt above a Pinte of holy Water about the Room.</p>
            <p>My Mother being returned from the Church, and finding the Maid thus bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, ſhe demanded of her the cauſe thereof; and the poore ſilly wench told all that had paſt, and the pickle wherein ſhe had found me, as alſo ſpending her judgement on the whole, that aſſuredly it was a Devil that was come into the chamber: Now my Mother, although ſhe was not of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> his kin, yet ſhe related the ſtory to my Father, who laugh'd at it, and ſaid it was but a meere whimſey, endeavouring to perſwade the maid out of her Chriſtian name, and making her believe that there was no ſuch thing as ſhe had related; but one of my Fathers men coming immediately after the maid into the chamber, and having ſeen me in the ſaid pickle, whereas ſhe queſtion'd me on the premiſſes, did change the ſuſpition which my Father harboured, that the maid might be deceived by reaſon of her ſimplicity.</p>
            <p>The knaviſh Ape came back againe to our houſe the following night, and having emptied a purſe-full of Counters, which he had ſpread about the table in the Hall, juſt as if he had been caſting up of Accounts, and getting into the Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, he there having flung down ſeverall Platters and Diſhes, before day, made his retreat again betwixt the barres of a ſmall window, which had never a ſhut; and which was his accuſtomed paſſage. Now when the maids had diſcovered the pranks which he had plaid, they told them unto my Father and Mother, who were thereby almoſt induced to beleive, that a Spirit did indeed haunt our houſe: And the impreſſion; which our Men-Servants did receive thereof, even perſwaded them alſo to conceive, that they had ſeen ſeverall Ghoſts; and one of them told for certain, how that he riſing out of his bed about eleven of the clock at night, to make water out of the window, having forgot to carry up his chamber-pot, had perceived ſomething in the garden which did leap from tree to tree; whereupon my Father ſwore, that all of them together (ſince they would needs make him believe that Spirits did reign in and about the houſe) ſhould by turns watch at ſome one window, to ſee whether any thing did appeare, and to bring him word of it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.</p>
            <p>And being a man that ſtuck to his reſolves, what he had determined was accompliſhed; and for eight nights together ſome one of our Servants had <pb n="68" facs="tcp:59287:41"/>alwaies watched, or at leaſt pretended to have done ſo (for that I believe they eaſily gave way to, and ſuffered themſelves to be overcome by ſleep) when as he that had the watch the ninth night, came and told my Father that he had ſeen ſomebody in the garden; whereupon my Father took a Piſtol and went as ſoftly as he could, together with his ſervant, to the ſuppoſed place, where he no ſooner arrived but he ſaw a man fly thence towards a part of the Wall, which was broken down; and he running after him, ſhot off his Piſtol in the aire, which ſo affrighted the party who fled, that together with his ſtumbling againſt a ſtone, he could not any longer ſupport himſelf, ſo that my Father overtook him before that he had time to get up againe; and by his voice, which he was conſtrained to make known, by his begging to be forgiven, our ſervant diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that it was a Peſant, who lived in an adjacent Market-town, or Borough, and by his having a Basket, wherein was two or three Bon-Chrettin pears, my Father perceived that he was come thither to ſteale Fruit: However, his courage was ſo farre from taking revenge on ſo contemptible a raſcall, as that he ſatisfied himſelf with the giving of him three or four ſound kicks in the breech, and the menacing of him to deliver him up into the hands of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, in caſe he returned to commit the like miſdemeanour; whereunto he added a very pleaſant and plauſible act of Clemency; <hi>Goe too inſatiable Gulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guts,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I protest I ſee its but lost labour to endeavour to hinder thee from ſtealing of my fruit, for that I cannot keep watch every night, nor will I be at the charges of heightning my Walls. But let us make an agreement, how many Pears willeſt thou by the yeare, on the condition that you ſhall no more come and ſteale them?</hi> Wilt thou be content with one hundred? Whereunto this bruite villain made anſwer, <hi>and by my Fay Sir, ſo I might be looſer by the bargaine.</hi> Which anſwer ſeemed to be lively and naturall unto my Father, that inſtead of its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him angry, it begat a fit of laughter in him, and cauſed him to diſmiſſe the fellow, continuing onely his former threats againſt him, being very well pleaſed to have found out what a ſtrange kinde of Ghoſt it was, which our Men had ſeen galloping on the top of the Trees, but as concerning the Spirit, who had tormented me, and ravag'd the Houſe, he knew not what to deeme of him.</p>
            <p>On the morrow my Father entring into the Houſe, where the Ape was kept, he found him faſtned with an Iron chaine in the Houſe of Office, and asking a Labourer who had his dwelling there, whoſe Beaſt that was? he anſwered that it belonged unto a friend of his, who had left it in truſt with him, adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that it was true, the ſaid Ape had played many mad pranks; having the day before been at a Barbers Shop, and returning home, took a diſh-clout, and wrapt it about the Cats neck, and having ſtoln a paire of Siſſers, the Ape eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed to trim the Cat, in imitation of what he had ſeen in the Barbers ſhop, and cut off all the Cats Whiskers; however I ſhould be glad to be rid of her, for that ſhe plagues me extreamly, and I have been conſtrained to chaine her up in this manner, becauſe that within two dayes after I had her, ſhe got into your Houſe, and where (I apprehend) ſhe would returne to doe ſome more miſchiefe, in caſe I ſhould let her looſe; whereupon my Father making a ſtrict enquiry of the prefixed day, wherein the Ape (according to the Clownes ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) ſhould have been at our Houſe, diſcovered that ſhe was the Devill, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there had been ſo much noyſe made, of which they ſtood ſo much in feare.</p>
            <p>Whereby you may obſerve, that poore ſpirited fellowes doe uſually deceive themſelves, and conceive pannyck feares, in the ſame ſort as our people did; and as for your ſelfe who live neare unto the Villages, you may beſt judge of it; that there is not ſo little a Hamblet, where its not rumor'd, that Spirits doe haunt it; and in the meane while, in caſe the buſineſſe were well enquired into, it would appeare, that the Inhabitants have grounded theſe their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <pb n="69" facs="tcp:59287:41"/>on ordinary accidents, and naturall cauſes, the reaſon whereof is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from their dull, and groſſe beetle-heads; and its a wonder to my ſelfe, that during my Infancy, I never was ſubject to be frightned by ſuch bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears, for ever when our Maids (thinking to correct me for ſome tricks, which were not pleaſing unto them) told me they would cauſe me to be eaten up by the Beaſt which came and gave me a viſit one Morning, when as I was yet a Bed; I heeded it as much, as if they had juſt ſaid nothing at all.</p>
            <p>I muſt needs paſſe by ſeverall pretty waggeries, which I committed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this my Non-age, that ſo I may aſcend a little higher; for when I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto the yeares of diſcretion, I had a Maſter appointed me, to teach me to write and read, but I ſtayed not long with him, for I was put to School to the Parſon, who ſoon taught me that little Latine which he had.</p>
            <p>And by I know not what ſecret inſtinct of Nature, I was incited to hate the unworthy actions, the ſottiſh talk, and the ridiculous wayes of my School-fellowes, who were all of them my Fathers Tenants Sonnes, brought up but rudely according to the Country faſhion; I inſtructed them how they were to behave themſelves, but if they followed not my precepts, I then laid on them to ſome tune, ſo that we were always at daggers drawing; for theſe inferiour Soules, being not ſenſible of the good which I intended them, and not conceiving, <hi>that he who loveth well, alſo chaſtiſeth well,</hi> did at every time make oppoſition, and ſaid unto me in this Gibbridge; <hi>How now? becauſe you are a Gentleman, you thinke you may domineere over us,</hi> with a thouſand ſuch like ruſticall impertinencies and fopperies; ſometimes they complained to their Parents of my ſeverity, and ſo exaſperated the buſineſſe, that they came and brought my Father to warne me from the beating of their children, who durſt not revenge themſelves of me, but I did ſo cunningly plead mine owne cauſe, that they were conſtrained to avouch that I had all the reaſon in the world, to correct thoſe abſurdities which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>Oftentimes hearing my Father diſcourſe of Univerſities, in which there were Colleges to inſtruct youth, and where all kind of peoples children were admitted of; I paſſionately deſired to go thither, for to enjoy ſo good company, whereas at home I onely converſed with Countrey Louts, and bruite Coridons: My Father, perceiving that I was naturally inclined to Learning, would not at all divert me from the ſame, in reſpect he full well knew, that it was but a very ill Trade for me to follow the Warres as he had done. Now whereas the Colleges of our parts, were not according to his Phantaſie, notwithſtanding all my Mothers obſtacles and moans, he himſelfe having ſome urgent affaires at <hi>Paris,</hi> took me along with him, and boorded me with the Maſter of the College at <hi>Lyſieux,</hi> unto whom was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by ſome of his friends, &amp; having given me in charge unto a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Advocate of his old acquaintance, whom he deſired to furniſh me with all neceſſaries; he returned into <hi>Britaine,</hi> leaving me to the mercy of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,</hi> who having dived into my ſmall capacity, they declared me to be fit for the fifth Claſſis, though it was by favour too.</p>
            <p>But marke you what a ſad alteration I met withall, and how farre I was to ſeek, being gotten quite beyond my byas; for I came very ſhort of the enjoyment of thoſe pleaſures, which I promiſed my ſelfe, and you may imagine that it was very ſtrange unto me, to be abſent from my Father, who oftentimes took me along with him unto ſeverall Lordſhips, which he had in <hi>Britain,</hi> and where I was alwayes called <hi>my young Maſter;</hi> and <pb n="70" facs="tcp:59287:42"/>you may imagine how it angred me, to have loſt that ſweet liberty which I enjoyed by galloping from place to place in the Countrey, going a Nutting, and plucking of grapes in the Vineyard, without feare of the Farmers; as alſo in following the Doggs and Hunts-men, for that as now I was more cloyſtered up by theſe Fryers, and was forc't to keep houres, to be aſſiſting at the Divine ſervice, at Meales, and at the Lectures, when as the Bell told, by which all our Actions are regulated, and in lieu of my former Maſter, the Parſon, who never gave me ſo much as an ill word; I had now to doe with a Regent, who had a terrible aſpect, and who walked alwayes with a whip in his hand, with which he could as well fence, as any one of his Calling. Nor doe I believe that <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Tyrant, (who after a ſtrange change of his Fortunes, became Scholemaſter, to the end that he might ſtill command) had a more majeſticall, haughty and terrible countenance than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Now the moſt difficult taske which I met withall, under this Mans do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, was that I was never to ſpeak but in Latin, and I could as well have been hanged as not to let ſlip ſome words of my Mother-tongue, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that I ever and anon incurred the penalty of receiving a blow with a Ferule; for my part I once reſolved to doe as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Scholler did, to keep ſilence for ſeven yeares together, in regard as ſoon as I opened my Mouth, I was accuſed and reviled with as hainous words, as if I had been the greateſt monſter in the world; but they might as well have cut out my Tongue, as have debarred me from ſpeaking truth; beſides I inclined ſo much towards the property of my Mothers ſexe, as that I would not let my Tongue grow mouldy for want of uſing of it, inſomuch that to let it have its full ſcope and carriere, I was conſtrained to make it pronounce the quainteſt Latin words, that I could deviſe, or had learned, unto which I added others in Pedlers French, to patch up my diſcourſe withall.</p>
            <p>My Chamber-Pedant was as proud and impertinent an Ape, as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble could be, he cauſed himſelf to be called
<hi>Hortenſius,</hi> out of a vaine-glory, as if he had been deſcended from that famous <hi>Orator</hi> who lived at <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Cicero</hi>'s time, or that he were as elegant as he; I ſuppoſe his right name was Maſter <hi>Heurt eur,</hi> but that he purpoſely altered it, to the end people might believe he had ſomething of a <hi>Roman</hi> in him, and that the Latin was as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to him, as his Mother-Tongue: In like manner, divers Authors of this our, Age, have more ridiculouſly clad their names in a
<hi>Roman</hi> diſguiſe, and have them terminated in an <hi>ius,</hi> that their books might have a better vent, and that the Vulgar and Ignorant might believe that they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by antient writers. Nor ſhall I need to trouble my ſelfe to name them farther, you need but to repaire to
<hi>Pauls</hi> Church yard, or to Ducke <hi>Lane,</hi> where you may know them by their workes.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding that my Maſter committed the like folly, and that he was endowed with an innumerable quantity of ſuch like mock-vertues: All of us Scholars were not a jot ſorry for it, not ſo much I will promiſe you as to finde his inexpreſſable dogged and miſerable covetous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which made him pocket up the greateſt part of our boord Wages, to feed us onely on <hi>Poore John,</hi> or empty Platters: And as then to my great griefe and regret I did learne, that all the words which doe expreſſe the diſaſters and misfortunes of Scholars, doe by a very remarkable fatality, begin with a P. as firſt of all, touching our Maſters themſelves, they are Pedants, and Penurious fellowes, we the Scholars are pitifull, poor, painfull, puniſht, pennileſſe, and ſuch like Epithets, which are ſo numberleſſe, that there would be three maine things wanting to ſumme them up unto you, a <pb n="71" facs="tcp:59287:42"/>good Dictionary, a great deale of Patience, and a good deale of Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>As for our Breakfaſt and after-noons Lunchins, we were even at the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a moſt accurſed mercileſſe perſon, who purpoſely to bereave us of our pittances, took a walk by his Maſters command, at the very inſtant that he ſhould have delivered them unto us, purpoſely to ſpare charges, and to make us faſt out a bad dinner, when as nothing was ſet before us, but what my Maſter had a minde we ſhould eate, nor could we ever crave ſo much favour at his hands, as to obtaine any Rediſhes, Sallat, Muſtard or Vinegar, leſt they might beget in us a comming appetite, or a good ſtomach to our victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls: Maſter <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> my learned Tutor, was one of thoſe who loved ſuch like Sentences, as thoſe which were engraven on <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and therefore he wrote <hi>Nequid nimis,</hi> over our Kitchin doore, that the world might take notice, that it ſtood not with his good liking, that a Man ſhould ſurfeit with the Banquets, and Quickſhawes, which were there to be made ready.</p>
            <p>Good God! a moſt pittifull meſſe in compariſon of that which the very Swine-heards of our Village did daily feed on; and for all that, we were termed to be Gluttons, and yet we were conſtrained to dip our hands in the diſh one after the other, by a Mathematicall rule; our Pedant accounted thoſe his darlings, who were ſatisfied with ſuch a ſmall proportion, as was allotted them, but you may imagine that they were Cockneyes, daintily Pompered up, and who were ſoon glutted: but as for my ſelfe, it was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe with me, for I was not brought up ſo delicately, however I had never a whit the better there, although my Maſter would out-face me, that I did eate more than foure others, when as God knowes, I had but my juſt allowance; Finally, it was unpoſſible for me to ingratiate my ſelfe with him, and at our Meales, he continually harped upon a Lecture of abſtinency, which was alwaies meant to me; he alledged <hi>Cicero,</hi> who ſaith,
<hi>That a Man muſt onely Eate to Live, not Live to Eate:</hi> and thereunto he annexed ſeverall Examples of the Sobriety of the Antients; nor did he forget the ſtory of the Captaine who was found a rooting of Turnipps for his repaſt; moreover, he manifeſted unto us, how that when the body is over-burdened with humours, the ſpirits could not exerciſe their neceſſary functions, telling us, that we were put to him to ſtudy and not to glut our ſelves with Meat, that therefore we ſhould have a greater reſpect to the one, than to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But if any Phyſitian had been preſent, and had ſided with us, as having the better cauſe, he would have confuted our Pedant, and proved, that there is nothing worſe for children, than to make them Faſt; Beſides, doe you not thinke that he had a great deale of reaſon to preach Abſtinency, whileſt eight of us were preying upon one poor leg of Mutton, he had a whole Capon to himſelfe, ſo that never was <hi>Tantalus</hi> more temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Hell by thoſe lovely Apples, which he could not obtaine, than we were by thoſe dainty morſells which we durſt not touch.</p>
            <p>And whenſoever any of us chanced to commit an Error, he then enjoyned him a very profitable Pennance as to himſelfe, for he put them out of Commons for ſome certaine dayes, and kept them at Bread and Water, whereby he alſo kept cleane Sheets, and ſpared the Money he ſhould have laid out in Rods. Now on Holy dayes, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When the Principall of our Colledge, who was a very brave ſparke, was monyed, and gave entertainment to his Friends, we were preſent at the Feaſt, and at the ſerving up of the laſt courſe, with the Fruit, we preſented ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Epigrams unto the Gueſts, who in returne of our Verſes, gave ſuch a parcell of Tarts, Cuſtards, Fruit, and ſuch like quickſhawes, and ſometimes alſo ſome ſmall fowle, which were not as yet taken from the board, as that we were faine to tip the ſeams of our Gownes, to ſtuffe them up therein, juſt like unto a Wallet.</p>
            <p>And the beſt meales that ever I did eate at the greateſt Princes Tables of the world, never were ſo pleaſing and delicious unto me, as thoſe conqueſts which I purchaſed by my Poetry; O you moſt pitiffull Verſes, which I have ſince that time made, which never as yet did produce me any ſalary, I prized ſo high as thoſe, which I preferred before an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
            <p>Nor was I leſſe pleaſed, when at the ſolemne Feaſt of our Lord, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate unto whom my Father had recommended me, ſent and invited me to dinner, ſince that for my ſake the good people inlarged their ordinary, with ſome minc'd Pyes, which I aſſaulted and fell aboard on, with as much reſolution as a couragious and magnanimous King would beſiege a Rebellious City: But together with my dinner, my mirth was at a ſtand; being ſtraightway examined, concerning my progreſſe in Learning, and in caſe I gave not a punctuall and ready account thereof, I was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that my Father ſhould be made acqainted therewith; It is an unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable truth, that let a child be of what diſpoſition ſoever he will, he will be ſure to be more addicted to play than to ſtudy, as I my ſelfe was in thoſe dayes; however (though I ſay it my ſelfe) I muſt needs tell you, that I was one of the learnedſt of all our Claſſis, whereby I loſt nothing neither, for the Advocate, perceiving my ingenuity, he alwayes gave me ſome few ſhillings, which he put upon the account of my Fathers Law-ſuits, and with this money, in ſtead of playing at Tennis, I bought certaine bookes, which they call Romances, containing the proweſſe of the Knights of old, and not long after one of my companions lent me one to read called <hi>Morgant</hi> the Giant, which abſolutely bewitched me, having never before read any thing but <hi>Ciceroe</hi>'s familiar Epiſtles, and
<hi>Terences</hi> Comedies; at length I was wiſht to a Book binder upon the

I proteſt unto you Sir, that at this time I deſire to be as ignorant as I was then at that time, in regard I ſhould enjoy a great deale <pb n="73" facs="tcp:59287:43"/>of pleaſure, in peruſing ſuch like trifling ſtories, whereas at preſent I am conſtrained to make-another gueſſe divertiſement, for that I cannot light upon any one Author that pleaſeth me, unleſſe I could paſſe by his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance; for to tell you the truth, though I knew where all Books are to be found, yet know I not where to finde a good one; nay, I will hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prove unto you, that there is not one good book in all the world, when as I ſhall treat of this paradoxe, and evidence unto you, how that in all of them, there are very great defects which ought to be amended, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take notice that I reſpect ſuch books, as our Religion doth honour and allow of.</p>
            <p>My greateſt paſtime as then was to read the feats of Chivaldry, and I muſt needs confeſſe that it edged on my courage and begot in me an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible longing to goe and ſeek adventures abroad in the world, for I conceited it would be as eaſie for me to cut a man in ſunder, as an Apple in two, and it pleaſed me beyond imagination, when as I reade of a huge ſlaughter among the Gyants, who carbonaded one another as ſmall as minced meat, and the blood, which flowed from their bodies in rivulets, and violent ſtreams, ſeemed to me to be a River of Roſewater, in the which, I bathed my ſelfe moſt deliciouſly, and at other times I imagined that I was the ſame <hi>Damoſel,</hi> who kiſſed the

            <p>Thus I became an <hi>Arch wagge,</hi> and a very
<hi>Rake-hell,</hi> nor retained I any thing of our Countrey breeding, not ſo much as the very accent of our ſpeech, for that I boorded with Normands, Picards, Gaſcons, and rich Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſians, of whom I learned new cuſtomes; and I had already gained the reputation of being a <hi>Pestilent-fellow,</hi> from that in the night time, I haunted the Court yards with a Bulls peezle in my breeches, to belabour thoſe who (with reverence be it ſpoken) went to the houſes of Eaſement; my Cap was flat, my Doublet was Buttenleſſe, faſtned with Pins or Points; my Gown was all betattared and patcht, the Collar of my Doublet was black, and my Shooes were white; finally I was in the right garbe and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage of a reverend Scholar, and he who would perſwade me to neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, was my profeſt Enemy; And when as formerly the ſole angry ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of my Maſters voice did make me ſhake like an <hi>Aspin</hi> Tree, blowne with the winde, as then a Canon ſhot ſturred me no more than a Crack backwards, I feared no more the laſh than a Flea-biting, as if my skin had been of Steele, and my daily occupations conſiſted in a thouſand waggeries, as in flinging Squibs, Crakkers, Dirt, and ſometimes ſtinking Surreverences, on the heads of the paſſengers, as they came under the Colledge windowes in the Streets; one time above the reſt, I did let downe out of the Window, a Basket tyed to a ſtring for a paſtry Man, unto whom I had throwne down ſixe pence, to put me ſome Cakes in it, and as I drew it up againe, my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who contrary to my knowledge was in the room juſt below me, drew in the Basket as it paſſed by his Window, and never quitted it untill he had quite emptyed it; my ſelfe running downe the ſtaires to diſcover, who had <pb n="74" facs="tcp:59287:44"/>ſerved me this ſly trick, I met with the Pedant, ſtanding at the threſhold of the houſe doore, and perceiving that it was he, I durſt not ſo much as open my mouth to him, though I grinned moſt hideouſly on him, being vexed to ſome tune, when as at the ſame inſtant, he commanded me to goe and invite another Maſter, his neighbour, to come and take an after-noons collation with him; well, away I went with a heavy heart, and brought his gueſt into the very chamber, where I ſaw no other Cakes on the Table, but my owne Cakes, and of which he never proffered me ſo much as the leaſt crum, ſo baſe a
<hi>Cluſter-fist</hi> was he: behold I pray how well he could pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the Lawes of pilfering, by ſherking on his Diſciples, to feaſt his friends; but though I ſaid little or nothing, yet I thought with my ſelfe I will be even with you good Maſter <hi>Pinch-penny</hi> I'le warrant you, though I ſhould hang for it, for e're long I ſhall ſhew you a trick of my skill.</p>
            <p>Now an occaſion to be revenged of my Maſter proffered it ſelfe ſhortly after, as well as I could have wiſhed it, for that the Father of one of our companions had ſent our Maſter a Hare Pye for a preſent, commending it highly; the very firſt time that he taſted of it, was at our Table, for that he delighted it ſeemed, to eate that which was good, and rare before us, purpoſely to ſet our teeth on water, yet he did not ſo much as preſent the leaſt part there of to his Son, who had ſent it him; I heard him give com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that it ſhould be carryed back againe into his Study, for that he valued it as much as his Books, loving the nouriſhment of his Body, better than that of his Minde: the place wherein it was lockt up, was onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed with boords, and joynted and lined on both ſides with old rotten Mats, the which I ripped aſunder at his being abſent; and whereas I as then was very ſlender, a <hi>Gaſcon,</hi> who was one of my luſtyeſt comrades, lifting up a thwart beame by maine ſtrength, I at length ſlipt into the famous Study, as ſacred to <hi>Bacchus</hi> and
<hi>Ceres,</hi> as to the <hi>Muſes,</hi> where prying into all holes and corners, peeping under the Shelves, and toſſing all the Books topſie turvy, truly I could find nothing at all, and relenting my misfortune to my companion, who with a great deale of impatiency expected me without; I had well nigh paſt both my leggs under the beame to come out againe back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when as ſtooping my body very low, to croude my ſelfe through, I perceived a great cheſt, wherein the year before there had been a Garden made, and it came into minde by the inſpiration of ſome little Devill (as I thinke) that the Pye might happily be there, whither returning, I found it to be even ſo, the cruſt thereof was very hard, and very ill ſavoured, and extreamely ſcanty of Butter, wherefore I concluding with my ſelfe, that it would be an umannerly part to carry away all; I leaft the Coffin and onely took the Carcaſſe, in lieu whereof, I put therein a paire of dirty Socks, which were thruſt into a hole thereby, and having covered the Caſe againe, I packed up my Veniſon in a brown paper, gave it to my comrade, and purſued it and him, as faſt as if I had been a hunting indeed, for that I longed to get out of the Study againe with a whole skin: Nor need I ſweare that it remained not long in our clutches, nor were we much troubled to reſolve where to hoord it up ſafe, for we put it all up into our Natural cheſts before night, and we muſt of neceſſity have had a window in our breaſts, as <hi>Momus</hi> deſired to have, in caſe any one would have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to diſcover our theft.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hortenſius</hi> our Pedant never thought of his Pye till the next day, when as it coming into his mind, he commanded his Paſtry-Man to go &amp; invite another old Pedant to breakfaſt with him, who was an old Fellow-Toper of his, and to tell him that he would let him taſte of a noble Hare Pye, in caſe he would <pb n="75" facs="tcp:59287:44"/>bring a quart of his beſt new Wine with him, for to allay the drought which the eating of the Spices would beget in their throats. The old Pedant failed not to come at the houre appointed, with as much Wine as <hi>Hortenſius</hi> had ſent for, and as ſoon as he was entred the Chamber, the Paſtry-Man went to reach the Pye out of the Caſe, and ſet it upon the Table, where it was no ſooner placed, but the dotard Pedant tooke up a Knife, and running his Knife into the ſame hole where the crum had formerly been cut up, which he thought had been whole, he rummaged with his Knife round about the Pye, holding his other hand faſt upon the cruſt, and ſaid, goe too, goe too, let us ſee what the belly of this Pye doth containe, whereunto he added, Good Maſter
<hi>Hortenſius,</hi> Lord what an admirable knife have you here, verily it cuts as it were of it ſelfe, for I'le aſſure you, I doe not put any force at all to it; <hi>Hortenſiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> burſt out with laughter, to ſee the Dotard was ſuch an Idiot, as to put his Knife in the ſame hole where the Pye was cut up before, whereat the old Pedant ſlinging off the lid of the Pye, asked what reaſon he had to laugh at him? and his eyes being not capable to diſcerne what was in the Pye, he drew forth his Spectacles, and putting them on, finding the foule Socks in ſtead of the Hare, he ſuppoſed that <hi>Hortenſius</hi> had purpoſely put this trick upon him, and upon that ſcore did flout and jeere him, which affront the old foole being not willing to brook, he ſnatch'd up his quart of Wine, and clapping it under his Gown, marched away in a great fury.
<hi>Hortenſius,</hi> who was worſe tranſported than he, let him depart without making any excuſe unto him, and did not know whom to ſuſpect for ſtealing his Hare. As to his Paſtry-Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, by whom he ſent it to his Study, his fidelity was ſo well knowne unto him, as it was unqueſtionable, for this good Servant was a ſecond ſelfe to him, he was his <hi>Achates,</hi> his <hi>Pirithous</hi> and his <hi>Pylades,</hi> whoſe goodneſſe was ſo great, that it repaired the inequality which was betwixt their conditions; he had the keeping and diſpoſall of the Moneyes, and yet ſhod not his Mule at all: And as for my part, the greateſt crime I believe he was guilty of, was, that he ſomewhat courtailed our Commons, and for this reaſon we gave him that nick-name of being <hi>Hortenſius</hi> his Siſſors; but it was hardly credible that he would be ſo ignoble as to imploy himſelfe in the clipping of his Maſters Coyne, wherewith he had ſo ingenuouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted him: But it was more likely that ſome of us Scholars had done the fact, and the Pedant likewiſe was of the ſame opinion, knowing full well that there were ſome cunning Shavers amongſt us, who were well verſt in the Art of picking Locks; however not ſuſpecting any one in particular, as to the fact committed, he would willingly (had he durſt, ſo farre his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tranſported him) have cauſed our bodies to be opened to know the truth of the buſineſſe, as <hi>Tamberlain</hi> did to the Soldier, who had ſtolne Milke from a poor Countrey Woman. Finally he reſolved to puniſh us all, that ſo he might not faile to puniſh the guilty, which, by his leave, was a groſſe piece of injuſtice; but what a piece of injuſtice did he impoſe on us, even the ſame which I formerly mentioned unto you, and the which might conduce the more to his diſadvantage and profit; for he purpoſely dined before we left School: and afterwards lockt himſelfe up in his Study, and when we were come from Morning prayer, our Paſtry-Man was not to be found, ſo that we wanted our halfe penny Cakes, after which we ran with more earneſtneſſe than we did out of Schoole, when we had got leave to play; and believe me at the very time of the Bakers bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Cakes home, we were ſeized with a fit of joy, although theſe Colledge-Cakes were as hollow-hearted as the Pedants our Maſters, for <pb n="76" facs="tcp:59287:45"/>inſtead of Crum, they were filled with nothing but winde; for you imagine we were deviliſh hungry by dinner time, and yet we were ſet downe to a Table, which was covered with nothing but a Cloth, as white as a Scullion-boyes ſhirt, and as for Napkins, the uſe of them was forbidden us, becauſe we wiping our fingers on them, dawb'd them with ſuch greaſe, as ſerves to feed ſuch ſlovens as lick them: But we hungry Soules as we were, having demanded our Dinner, the Paſtry-man brought up the Pye covered, and told us, <hi>It is my Maſters will that we all ſhare of this;</hi> A famiſht <hi>Norman</hi> took off the lid, and finding nought therein ſave the foule Socks, fell into ſuch a paſſion againſt the Paſtry-man, who ſufficiently jeered us, that he flung all the Cruſt of the Pye at his
<hi>ſlouching Chops,</hi> and afterwards took ſanctuary in one of his friends Chambers, where he remained a whole day, for feare of
<hi>Hortenſius:</hi> The <hi>Gaſcon</hi> and my ſelfe, laughed in our ſleeves, and had much adoe to containe our ſelves, though our bellies were as badly furniſhed as the reſt, and all of us being deſtitute of a dinner, which we could not obtaine from our Maſter, we joyned our ſtocks and ſent for ſomething from the Cooks, and thus the innocent ſuffered for the criminall, and our Pedant never knew it was I that ſtole his Hare.</p>
            <p>Much about that time I was in the third forme, where I had not given any thing for the Maſters preſent or yearely gift, nor for Candles, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it drew nigh unto the time of breaking up School, and the reaſon was, my Father had forgotten to ſend it me with the reſt of my allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, whereupon our Regent being very much diſpleaſed, exerciſed all the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gors he could againſt me, ſuch as were not impoſed on any other Scholars, and when he could handſomely, he took an occaſion to revile and affront me upon that ſcore, and was very well pleaſed when my comrades called me <hi>Gliſco,</hi> alluding to a rule in the <hi>Dispauterius Grammer,</hi> where there is <hi>Gliſco nihil dabit,</hi> whereby they meant I would give him nothing, and by reaſon the Son of a rich Treaſurer had payed the Maſter in faire Quadruples, he was called <hi>Nic dator,</hi> by another rule of the ſaid Rudiments, and thus by this mingling of French and Latine together, their drift was to make me ſenſible, that he had given our Regent good Gold, and here you muſt hold me excuſed, if I cloy you with College Apothegms which I could not tell how to avoid, ſince they lay ſo pat in my way.</p>
            <p>And to the end, I might adde a greater torment to my Pedants ſpight, finding that he made uſe of all occaſions whatſoever, to cloak thoſe chaſtiſements, which he was reſolved to inflict on me, I fell hard to my ſtudyes, and quite abſtained from all kinde of waggiſh knaveries, inſomuch that my Maſter was ready to run wilde, and to lay ſome ſuppoſed crime to my charge, ſo ſtrangely was this ignoble and baſe Soule tranſported, when as his exorbitant avarice was not ſatiated, and by his baſeneſſe and wiles I had like to have ſuffered Shipwrack, had not my Money come in time; which I reſolved to preſent unto him, in the ſame manner as the Pedants had introduced it to ſatisfie their ever-gaping purſe, by preſenting him a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Criſtall glaſſe, full of comfits, with a Lemmon in it, in the ryne where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I had not ſtuck my Gold, as it was the uſuall cuſtome, but had thruſt it into the Lemmon it ſelfe through the hole which I had made therein; And preſenting the ſame unto him, with a Counterfeited melancholy viſage, I told him, Sir, you know that I am farre from home, and the Meſſenger hath not as yet brought me that which is requiſite for your yearly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, in the meane while I doe preſent you with this from my ſelfe, as an earneſt of ten Crowns in Gold, which you ſhall receive within theſe fourteen dayes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:59287:45"/>This faire Promiſe did even pierce through the hard rock which environ'd his heart, and obſtructed his being moved with the reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full amity wherewith I accoſted him; He accepted the Glaſſe, and thanking me with a ſmiling countenance, poured the ſweet Meats into my Cap, and gave the Citron to a favourite of his, not knowing that it was as pretious as any Apple in the <hi>Hesperides</hi> Garden, and that I might have the more pleaſure, I let him alone, but when I ſaw that the Leſſons were all given, and that the leaſt boy was ready to goe forth of the School; I went to the favourite, and sked him if he would change his Citron for my ſweet-meats, which he agreed unto, loving the ſweet-meats better than the ſower Lemmon, and at the ſame time we returned towards our
<hi>Domine,</hi> whom I pulled by his long fleeve, as he was correcting a Theam, and asked him ſmiling, if he would ſee my Citron; at which words, I opened it in the middle, and ſhewed him the Gold between the clouds, telling him, that he ſhould not ſtay ſo long as I told him for his Gold; no, ſaid he, as he took the Gold, this is then for me, I will give you the Citron againe; and praiſing me not a little for my ſubtilty and wit, he blamed me for hazarding the loſſe of my Gold; whilſt he was talking there, the Scholars applauded the jeſt with their Books, which they clapt againſt the Formes, as is uſuall on ſuch like occaſions, and with eagerneſſe had like to have broken their Satchell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrings, Benches and all.</p>
            <p>After which, that ſhye and untractable <hi>Animal,</hi> being now fully tamed, and appeaſed, uſed me with as much civility, as he did the others; but it was not my Fortune to enjoy theſe his Careſſes long, becauſe my Father ſent Letters for me to goe into the Countrey, to aſſiſt at the wedding of two of my Siſters which were to be marryed in one day, the one to a brave gallant Gentleman, and the other to a Councellor of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Britany,</hi> ſo thither I went along with the Meſſenger, nor was I ever gladder in my life, for all my buſineſſe then was, to make good chear and be merry; Nevertheleſſe the great deſire, I had to learne the Arts and Sciences cauſed me to beg leave of my Father to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againſt the Feaſt of Saint <hi>Ramy,</hi> when the Lectures doe againe commence, at which time I was about thirteen yeares of age, and was exalted to the ſecond Claſſe: and ſo conſecutively in the enſuing yeares, I was preferred to the reſt, and thus finally I paſt the whole courſe of my Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; But I ſhall not trouble you any more with the ſeverall paſſages incident thereunto, and which befell me during the ſaid time, for I feare, it would but offend your eares, and I have almoſt tyred my ſelfe with relating ſuch fopperies, ſince I may give you a more pleaſant entertainment,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">Good Lord Sir, ſaid the
<hi>Burgundian</hi> gentleman, do you thus cruelly deprive me of the recitall of your moſt pleaſing adventures? doe you not know that theſe Actions of our youth, are extreame pleaſing, and that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light our ſelves in hearing the adventures even of beggars and baſe fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes; as of <hi>Guſman de Alfaracha</hi> and of <hi>Lazarillo de Tormes;</hi> And how then ſhould I not reap a great deale of ſatisfaction to have the adventures of a Gentleman and a Scholar, who thereby giveth an evidence of the ſubtilty of his wit, and of his great cunning even during his youth? I but Sir, ſaid
<hi>Francion,</hi> give me leave to tell you, that you will reape a farre greater ſatisfaction, when I ſhall tell you what befell me, in a riper age, for theſe are more ſerious paſſages, and wherein you will find a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contentment.</q> Whereto the <hi>Burgundian</hi> anſwered, aſſuredly I can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe nothing but wonders at the rehearſall of your Courtiers life, for I <pb n="78" facs="tcp:59287:46"/>have already heard ſome incredible paſſages thereof, by certain perſons who came from the Court. Wherefore I could wiſh that you had already attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the relation of it, and that you had run through all your ſeveral Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, although you ſhould have been whipt above ten times at each of them, leſſe I would not willingly have you skip over any, or anticipate time. Whereunto
<hi>Francion</hi> made anſwer,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">Sir, you doe very graciouſly repreſent unto your ſelfe, things as if they were preſent, and truly I am not a little obliged unto you for your favour, in deſiring I ſhould be often whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; where thinke you ſhall I meet with a breech that may be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt ſo many aſſaults? and if you be in earneſt, you ſhall doe well to have an Armour of proof forged for my Bum, which you muſt have painted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in fleſh colours, or elſe be pleaſed to lend me that skin of yours; Take you no care of that ſaid the <hi>Burgundian,</hi> we will provide for all.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And in this manner they entertained themſelves, with theſe and ſuch harmeleſſe Diſcourſes, which muſt not of neceſſity be forgotten, although they are not of ſo high a ſtrain as many others, for without them our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory would not be compleate. Our drift herein is, to behold an Image of the life of Man, ſo that it muſt be performed by ſeverall repreſentations. The Hiſtory of <hi>Francion</hi>'s Father, it is true, doth demonſtrate a Country Gentlemans life, who in his Youth hath ſeen ſomething of the Warres, and who as yet hath a Martiall heart, which deſpiſeth all other conditions or qualities of Men: the ſordid avarice of ſome Lawyers, which is there very aptly deſcribed, as well as all the reſt of their Knaveries and dogged di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſitions: After which the ſottiſhneſſe of ſome perſons, next the impertinency of ſome Pedants and School-Maſters, and laſtly the waggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Scholars; which is the field wherein <hi>Francien</hi> intends to expatiate his fancy in the ſequel of this Hiſtory, deſcribing alſo the vanities and errors of ſuch perſons, who thinke themſelves to be wiſer, richer, and better borne, than really they are, as Maſter <hi>Hortenſius</hi> did, and by the demonſtration of his rendring himſelfe ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to all the world, by whom he was jeered and flouted, others may be warned as by a faire leſſon which is laid before them. <hi>Francion</hi> took a great deale of delight in telling of theſe Stories, becauſe he retained in his Breſt the ſentiments of very good nature, which made him love all the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances of other Men.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe his diſcourſe was not ſo attentive, but that now and then he did caſt an eye upon the things he did behold round about him, and juſt as he had terminated the laſt Diſcourſe aforementioned, he could no longer forbeare, but would totally ſatisfie his curioſity; and drawing open the Curtaines of his Bed, he put out his head to caſt his eyes towards the fartheſt end of the Chamber: whereat the Lord of the Caſtle asked him, what is it you looke after Sir? I was ſeeing, ſaid
<hi>Francion,</hi> whether I could ſpye any one of your Servants, for I would deſire them to reach that lively Picture, which is faſtned to the Tapſtry hangings, being it is unpoſſible for me to diſcerne from hence, what it doth repreſent; I will goe and fetch it you, ſaid the Lord, and riſing up from his place, he took down the Picture, which was made in the forme of an Ovall, and not much bigger than a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyall, to carry in ones Pockets, and delivering it into <hi>Francion</hi>'s own hands, he ſaid unto the Lord, that he was ſorry he had mentioned it, becauſe it had cauſed him ſo much trouble; After which looking upon the Picture, and beholding the perfecteſt and moſt lovely choice beauty in the world pourtraited therein, he cryed out,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">Good Lord Sir, doe you uſe to place ſuch bewitching charmes in your gueſts Chamber, purpoſely to make them
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59287:46"/>dye inſenſibly, that ſo you may have theſe ſpoyles, Oh! you have killed me in the very ſhewing of me this Picture: All the world is not ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible as you are, ſaid the Lord, and if ſo be I were ſo, I had been dead long ſince, for that I have oftentimes contemplated the features &amp; allurements of that face;</q> When as
<hi>Francion</hi> beholding the lid of the Picture, for that it did lock, like unto a Box, he found <hi>Naiis</hi> to be written therein, what ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth that ſaid he? it is the faire ones name, ſaid the Lord, and ſhe is an
<hi>Italian</hi> Lady, as you may ſee by her dreſſing; an
<hi>Italian</hi> Gentleman, by Name <hi>Dorini,</hi> who paſſed this way not long ſince, did lend it me for eight days only, to the end that I might conſider it at full, and I had placed it in his Chamber, which is the privateſt of all my Caſtles, and which I reſerve as the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net for my pleaſures, Is this incomparable Lady ſtill alive, ſaid <hi>Francion?</hi> I doe not know anſwered the Lord, none ſave <hi>Dorini</hi> can reſolve us that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; Lord that you ſhould be ſo negligent as not to have informed your ſelfe thereof, ſaid <hi>Francion;</hi> it ſeems that you are of a gallant free diſpoſition, who account all things indifferent; It is very true ſaid the Lord, and I proteſt unto you, that being with,
<hi>Hellene,</hi> whom you went to ſee yeſterday, and who is but an ordinary beauty, I took as much delight in her company as I could have done, in the enjoyment of the incomparable <hi>Naiis,</hi> do but ſhut your eyes Sir, when as you are forced to kiſs an object which hath no attractiveneſs at all, &amp; yet Sir, your ſences will nevertheleſs be tickled with the pleaſure of the moſt perfecteſt love, and thereby you ſhall quench the ardent deſires, which you harboured to joyne your ſelfe unto a body, in which your eyes doe finde thoſe ſubjects beget an extreame paſſion in you.</p>
            <p>After which, <hi>Francion,</hi> having moſt attentively beheld the Picture, did fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten it with a pin at his Beds head, and afterwards continued his diſcourſe, as you ſee in the following Bokes, &amp;c.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O morrow (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) by the light of the Day I will look at leiſure on this picture, but for the preſent it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that I acquit my ſelf of that which I owe you, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of my Courtly, that I give you now an account of my Scholaſtical adventures. Suppoſe then you ſee <hi>Francion</hi> enter into the School, his lynings hanging out of his Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches down unto his ſhoes, his Gown wrapped about him, his Book under his arm, undertaking to give a Fillip to one, and a Bob unto an other. I kept pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly alwayes about me ſome fine Hiſtory which I did read, and did ſet my other Books before me, for fear my Maſter ſhould perceive me: My courage at that time much increaſing, I ſighed within my ſelf that I had not yet performed any exploit of War, when I was at that age wherein the Knights Errant had defeated an infinite number of their Enemies, and I know not how to expreſſe unto you the grief I entertained to ſee that my Power did not anſwer to my Will.</p>
            <p>Marvell not that I had rather read, than liſten to my Regent, for he was the greateſt Aſſe that ever mounted into a chair. He did teach us nothing but fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries, and cauſed us to imploy our time in ſtudies altogether unprofitable, commanding us to learn a thouſand of the moſt pedantical tromperies in the world. We diſputed very ſtiftly for places, and demanded queſtions of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but what queſtions think you? What is the Etymology of <hi>Luna?</hi> To which you muſt anſwer, That it is ſo called <hi>quaſi luce lucens aliena,</hi> as if in French we ſhould call a Shirt a Fleſh-bagg, becauſe it is a bagg we do put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our fleſh. Is not this excellent doctrine wherewith to ſeaſon a young ſpirit? Nevertheleſſe we did paſſe away our time in ſuch ridiculous vanities, and he who did anſwer beſt unto them, was in the reputation and quality of an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Sometimes this fooliſh Pedant would give us Verſes to make, and would allow that we ſhould take them word for word out of
<hi>Virgil,</hi> the better to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him, and that, to perfect us in ſome other Exerciſes, we ſhould make uſe of the ſtale Books of
<hi>Parnaſſus</hi> and <hi>Textor.</hi> If he gave us Proſe to make, we were to aſſiſt our ſelves with Books of the ſame ſtrain, from whence we took all manner of pieces to make a gallimoffry after the pedantick faſhion; And was not this a moſt uſefull method, and proper to inſtruct our underſtandings, and inform our judgements? What a ſhame it is to ſee, that even in our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities they are but a little better than Barbarians who reſide there for the <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59287:48"/>education of Youth? ought they not in a good hour to conſider that they ſhould rather inſtruct Children to invent ſomething of themſelves, and not ſend them to Common-places and Collections, the continual poring whereon doth ſerve but to dull and rebate their apprehenſions; for it is known, that in their Collections there is ſeldome to be found purity of language or good Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegmes, or Sentences, or Hiſtories well cited, or Similitudes well reported. Good God, how much are Fathers deceived, thinking they have ſent their Sons to Men filled with good and profitable knowledge! Theſe School-maſters are a Generation who come almoſt from the Plough to the Chair, and are for a while Uſhers, during which time they ſteal ſome vacant hours which they owe to the ſervice of their Maſters, to be peripatetical Students: As long as their Lenten Dinner is on the fire they conſult a little with their Books, and at laſt they proceed to be Maſters of Art. They only read Commentaries, and the Scholiaſts of Authors, the better to deſcant and to make their annotations on them. For the reſt, they know not what is civility, and a Child ought to have a good and a noble Nature, who under their charge is not corrupted by them, for they will let them alone in all manner of vicious habits without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving them.</p>
            <p>Our Regent, amongſt others of his good qualities, was indefatigable impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate to have us act ſome plays in French, accordingly as he had made them, for he had much of a Poet in him. He had many Scholars that were to be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and the deſire which tranſported me to ſee my ſelf a Prince once in my life, did cauſe me to act a part in his Play, for it was a Tragedy, and there were to be none in the Scene but Monarchs and Grand Signiors, and ſo great was my ambition, that I would be alſo the God
<hi>Apollo,</hi> who was to ſpeak in <hi>Latin</hi> in the <hi>Chorus.</hi> There was never any thing ſo ill ordered as was our Stage. To repreſent a Fountain they had taken the Cock out of the Kitchin, without covering it either with Boughs or Buckrom, and they had tyed up the Tops of the Trees to the Skye, bluſhing for ſhame amongſt the Clouds. Our Habits were very ill ſorted, for a Sacrificer of the Temple of the Pagans was cloathed in the Alb of a Prieſt, and had on his head the Cope in which they ſaid Maſſe in our Chappel. For the reſt, the Diſpoſure of the Acts were ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, and the Verſe ſo well compoſed, the Subject ſo high, and the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of it ſo excellent, that two months ſince having found ſome fragments of the Verſes amonſt my old Papers, I thought I ſhould have diſgorged all within me, ſo ſick they made me at the heart: Good God, ſaid I, Is is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that <hi>Franchion</hi> ſhould ever pronounce ſuch fooliſh words as theſe, and incontinently did throw into the Fire all thoſe horrible pieces. But when I Acted my part, there was nothing in the whole Play which ſeemed not to me to be extremely good, and when I would make other Verſes I did ſtrive to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate thoſe of my Maſters, Nay, I was ſo blind, that although I found the greateſt part of them in printed Comedies in the plays of <hi>Pathelin,</hi> and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the <hi>Roſe,</hi> and perceived how wretchedly he had patched them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet I grudged nothing at the glory which I had given to him. I cannot but here repreſent unto you one of the moſt ridiculous impertinences which he committed in that piece, to ſhew unto you as well the abſurdity of the plot as of his words.
<hi>Jupiter</hi> complained that his head did ake, and ſaid that he would lye down on the bed, deſiring that ſome lenitive remedies might be applyed to it; this had been good indeed, if at the ſame time the Author had feigned that his head had been big with <hi>Minerva.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In another part of the Plot there was a great ſlander contrived, that in the Tragedy I had been killed by mine Enemy, wherefore I was to act the part of a Fury who came to torment the Murtherer. When I was on the Stage with him whom I purſued, there was a third Actor, who alſo being to change his habit knew not where to leave thoſe habiliments which he had on before,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59287:48"/>But becauſe he was one who was familiar with the Regent, he covered his bare head with his Turband, and pulling off his coat he did throw it on his ſhoulders, although the Regent had another on before, the weather being then very cold. At the ſame time he whom I purſued in a wild poſture, having a burning Torch in my hand, being as it were ſurprized with horror to behold me, did begin to be out of his part, and to ſtammer in his complaints, and repeated one verſe ſix times over, being unable to call into his memory that which was to follow, and conceiving that I did remember it better than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, becauſe I had often heard him to repeat it, he ſaid unto me, What is that which is to follow? Prompt me <hi>Francion:</hi> But without minding what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, I looked up and down, on one ſide, and on the other. Our Regent being extremely angry to behold that ſottiſhneſſe, did come forth with his Book in his hand, without any reguard to the double habit he had on, and ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with his fiſt, ſaid unto him, Get thee gone thou Blockhead, I ſhall gain nothing but diſhonour by thee, leave off thy acting; wherupon he took the paper, and immediatly withdrew himſelf behind the Arras, thinking it was the pleaſure of the Regent. I ſeeing my Maſter accoutred in the ſame manner, (for our habits coming from a Mask that was danced before the King, were almoſt all the ſame) did believe that he came in his place to act that part which he could not perform, I took him therefore by the ſleeve as he himſelf had taught me, and cauſing him to turn, and run from one ſide to another, I ſo whiffled him on the face with my Torch, that I burned off allmoſt all his beard. My Companion who had failed in his part, obſerving my Maſter not to recite thoſe verſes in which he failed, did believe that he had forgot them as well as himſelf, and did prompt him ſo loud that one might eaſily have heard him to the lower end of the Hall, and thinking with himſelf that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly he was ſtruck deaf, he came forth upon the Stage, and ſpake them aloud in his ear. This confirmed me the more in my opinion that our Pedant would act the part of the man that killed me, and being more ſtrong than himſelf, I did ſo torment him, that at the laſt he was conſtrained to fall down on the ground. I proteſt unto you that the Pitch and Rozin which I burned did in ſuch a manner afflict his head, that what with it, and the thruſts and punches that I gave him, he did fall into a ſwound, and his ſpirits were ſo loſt, that he could not diſtinctly bid me let him alone. I will not diſſemble but that there was much malice on my ſide, and that expreſly I did it, to revenge my ſelf of the cruelty which he had exerciſed on me; For if my Companion had continued to act his part, I would not have been ſo miſchievous unto him: but I aſſure you, never in any Mummery was there more contentment taken than at our play, where the ſucceſſe did arrive ſo pleaſingly. I had the glory given me, for having played my part the beſt of all the Actors, who were ſome of them of the rudeſt ſort of the people of <hi>Paris,</hi> and according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of our Regent (who had in him no more humanity than a Hoggard) had every one of them a fair Handkerchief in his hand for want of a more gracefull poſture, and did pronounce their verſes as if they were ſinging them, and oftentimes with a far ſhriller, and a more diſagreeing tone than any of the reſt. To doe well I did quite contrary to that which my Maſter taught me, and when I was to ſalute any one, my reverence was after the manner of the Court, and not according to the mode of the Children of the Holy Ghoſt, whom he conſtrained us to imitate; And for other things I uſed no other ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, nor made any traverſes on the Stage, but only at ſuch time as reaſon did direct me: but I had leaſure to repent that I had ſo well perſonated the Fury; for my Regent obſerving that all the College, and many perſonages of Honour in the City did laugh at him, did take on me an exemplary revenge, and for the firſt fault which I afterwards committed he with his Rods did ſo pink my <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59287:49"/>breech, that a barber Chirurgion doth not mangle more the back of a ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to whom he doth apply his Cupping-glaſſes.</p>
            <p>At that time I lived with <hi>Hortenſius</hi> as I was before accuſtomed, yet he did intreat us more ſeverely than in the years precedent, and the Winter being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely cold, finding that he would allow us no fire, we were conſtrained to burn the boards of our Studies, the ſtraw of our Beds, and afterwards our Theam-books, to procure us a little heat. One day he was pleaſed to take the pains to viſit my Library, and finding there many ſabulous Hiſtories in the French tongue, he carried them all away with him, alleging, that they corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my good Inclinations, and did pervert my ſpirit; for it muſt be as he ſaid. Amongſt thoſe Books he found ſome ſo amorous, that they ſerved much to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame his heart with the love of the Daughter of the Advocate who payed my Penſion. Take notice by the way, that Love triumphs as much over the ſquare Cap of the Pedant, as over the Crowns of Kings. And that which did the more invite him to follow the Command of that little God, was, that he did ſee his power to be reverenced and eſteemed almoſt amongſt all the Books of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers. Being overcome by ſo agreeable a Temptation, he began to ſeek out all means to pleaſe his Lady, and did apparel and dreſſe himſelf more rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and more curiouſly than before he was accuſtomed to doe; for whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he changed his linnen but once a month, he now changed it every fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. Every morning he turned up his Muſtachioes with the handle of a hot ſpoon, and the Botcher our Porter was imployed to make two dayes to put n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w ſleeves to his old Caſſock, and to mend it every where, were it never ſo much torn in pieces. He never before did behold his own face but in a bucket of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but now he became ſo prodigal as to buy a very large Looking-glaſſe, in which he ceaſed not to obſerve if he made his Reverences with a good grace, and with what a plauſible carriage his other ordinary Actions were attended: and ſometimes he did put himſelf to too much trouble, for he had a deſire to ſee in how good a poſture he did read, and having caſt his eyes down on <hi>Tully</hi> which he had in his hands, he would lift them up to look on his glaſſe; but he could not thus content his Deſire, becauſe he found the Image which was there repreſented, did lift up its head as well as himſelf, and at that inſtant did not look down upon the Book, inſomuch that at the ſame time he would have been very willing to turn his eyes into two places at once. And although he was carefull enough of his Body, yet he purpoſed to gain the good will of his Miſtreſſe not by that meanes only; the qualities of his Mind, which ſeemed to him to be far more eminent, were thoſe forces in which he moſt confided. Every day he turned over the leaves of the Books of Love which he had taken from me, and from thence collected thoſe Diſcourſes, which in his judgement ſeemed beſt to fill his mouth, and to rectifie his underſtanding. Amongſt thoſe Volumes, there was one full of Metaphors, and barbarous Antitheſes, and of ſuch extraordinary Figures, that no Name is to be given to them; it was a gallamoffry ſo continued and confuſed, that the moſt apprehenſive ſpirit in the world muſt be obliged to demand, <hi>What is it?</hi> if he had a deſire to underſtand it: Nevertheleſſe he called this Author, the French <hi>Cicero,</hi> and formed all his ſtile according unto his, unleſſe that from ſome other of his time he took certain Phraſes, which to him ſeemed admirable, becauſe they were not common, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there were ſo many faults in them, that a Coſtard-monger who ſells Fruit in the corner of a ſtreet, would have diſcovered them, and reproved him, and his goodly Authors with him. I come now to account unto you the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which he held with his Miſtreſs, following therein thoſe Books which he had read. One day going to viſit her Father, and finding her alone, Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſell (ſaid he) I gain in loſing, and I loſe in gaining, that at this time loſing the company of Monſieur your Father, I gain yours, which yet makes me to be a loſer in another ſenſe, for I do loſe my liberty in hearing your Diſcourſe:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59287:49"/>The incomparable charms of your incomparable perfections, which none can magnifie enough, do ſo aſſail me, and hold me captive under their feet, that he is deprived of Reaſon who believeth he is able to defend himſelf againſt them; wherefore this ſhall alwayes be the Cauſe for which I will make bold to ſtile my ſelf your incomparable Servant.
<hi>Fremond</hi> (for ſo the Damoſel was called) had ſomething to do to return an anſwer to ſo extravagant a Salutation. In a ſhort time ſhe perceived the ſolly of the Perſon which before ſhe never ſaw ſo manifeſtly diſcovered. She could make her marker well enough, and the young Sparks of the College who were my Companions told me, they found by her deportment and complexion that ſhe loved the trade, and certainly they were not much miſtaken; for in the fourth year of her age, being deprived of her Mother, her jovial and frolick humor did afterwards tranſport her into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of love towards young Men who did court her in the view of her Father himſelf, who took it not much to heart, becauſe he was but a poor man, and hoped that ſhe might inveigle and circumvent ſome rich Servant, who might happily eſpouſe her. I remember very well, that when I was but a very boy, counterſeiting to take ſomething out of my pocket, ſhe came unto me, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her hand therein, ſhe did tickle me thereabouts all over; O how often, thinking of it, have I ſaid to my ſelf, Would I had now that favour which then I received, or had then that loſty ſtrength which now I have, I had tickled then that wanton in that place where it itched, and it is likely enough ſhe would have been well contented with it; for it is to be believed, that at that time ſhe had no experience of the pleaſures of Love, but only by Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>One day I addreſſed my ſelf unto her when ſhe was courted by a young Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, who, after ſome diſcourſe, demanded of me, If an Antient did not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that the worſt of wild beaſts is a Detractor, and of thoſe beaſts who are domeſtick, a Flatterer? I made anſwer, Yes, and that I had read it in <hi>Plutarch;</hi> but we ought now to correct that Apothegm, and maintain, that the worſt of domeſtick beaſts is a Pedant. The young Advocate having praiſed my Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, told me, That I had a moſt juſt reaſon ſo to ſpeak, and that he had been expoſed as well as my ſelf to the fury of thoſe mercileſſe Creatures. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards demanded of me, if I knew the Definition of a Pedant? Yes Sir, ſaid I, He is a Creature not to be made clean. You have juſt reaſon ſo to ſpeak, ſaid he; And I have heard, that the Rector of the Univerſity, with the Proctors, and other Deputies, going on <hi>Candlemas Eve,</hi> according to their Cuſtom, to preſent a Wax-candle to the King ſince deceaſed, one came and ſaid, Sir, Behold your Daughter the Univerſity, who is come to doe Reyerence unto you; O Lord! replyed the King, What a dirty Slut my Daughter is? Nevertheleſſe they did not forbear to make their approaches to him, and the Rector began his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to which he was attentive, but with much impatience; becauſe it was ſo full of Similitudes taken out of the propriety of Stones from <hi>Pliny,</hi> and of the Examples of Illuſtrious Perſonages, taken out of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> inſomuch that in the very beginning of his Diſcourſe, which promiſed to be long enough, having ſaid, Sir,
<hi>Alexander the Great</hi> going to the Conqueſt of <hi>Aſia;</hi> the King ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly replyed, What do you mean to do, he had dined then, and I have eaten nothing all this day? The Oration, which was to continue a long hour, was by this means made ſhorter, and the poor Pedants return'd into their own Kingdom, where with far more patience their flowers of Oratory might be liſmed to. The Courtiers who were preſent did make a gloſſe upon their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, they were amazed at the Hoods of theſe diſguiſed people, and compared the great Hood which the Rector had on, to that in which Mr.
<hi>Goning</hi> did put his Inſtruments to ſhew his tricks of activity. They were much troubled to give a reaſon, wherefore the Antients had invented thoſe venerable ornaments, and if it were colder in their time than in ours? But that which made them <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59287:50"/>laugh moſt was the dirt which imbroydered the robes of the Pedants, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that they brought ſo much along with them on their feet, that it ſeemed, all the durt on the other ſide of the bridge came along with them, the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the Kings Chamber was ſo full of it, that they were above two hours in making of it clean. And ſo <hi>Francion</hi> we may underſtand, that although you are not yet a Logitian, you give as good a definition as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf could doe, and that a Pedant is a Creature not to be made clean. But let us diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> ought not he to be excepted from this rule? is he a ſpru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer man than the reſt? of what humour is he? let me know little of him.</p>
            <p>On theſe words I began to vent forth whatſoever I underſtood of him, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles</hi> did never paint a Man better than I did ſet forth my Maſter by the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil of my Eloquence, inſomuch that I made
<hi>Fremond</hi> to laugh moſt heartily. When I had given them an account of all that I knew, ſhe told the young Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate the diſcourſe which the Pedant had with her ſome few days before, and they both reſolved to make good ſport with him. I immediately did underſtand their purpoſe, and ſaid unto <hi>Fremond,</hi> I ſwear unto you <hi>Mademoiſell,</hi> that he is become very amorous of you, for he never ſees me but he tells me that you are incomparably perfect, and demandeth of me if I know nothing of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. Say you ſo <hi>Francion,</hi> ſaid <hi>Fromond,</hi> doe me the pleaſure as to make him believe that he is infinitely in my favour, and that I never heard any man ſo cloquent as himſelf.</p>
            <p>Since I could ſpeak familiarly to him, I did not fail to acquit my ſelf of that charge, and better than <hi>Fremond</hi> hoped, for I ſo prevailed upon him, that on the next day he came to viſit her, and openly did make profeſſion of his Love. He laught at many Pedants who underſtood nothing of the myſtery of Love, and amongſt others at the Son of one of the Kings Profeſſors of the Greek Tongue, who being to viſit his Sweet-heart, according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of his Father, did uſe no Complement to her at all, but looked down with a baſhfull countenance; The Profeſſor being advertized of it, did demand of him why he did not entertain her Amorouſly, he made anſwer, that he knew not how to doe it; Out you Aſſe you, ſaid the Father to him, <hi>Nonne legiſti Ovidum de Arte Amand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>?</hi> but <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was determined to deport himſelf otherwiſe, and had read the Book intituled
<hi>The Kiſſes of Johannes Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundus,</hi> to teach him how he ought to kiſſe. The firſt time that ever he ſaw his Miſtreſſe he made unto her this learned Oration: Although that your prodigious attractions have ſurprized my Spirit which had before blaſphemed againſt the feather'd Arrows of <hi>Cupid,</hi> I ought now not only to implore the Altar of your Sweetneſſe, but indeavour to tranſport that incomparable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Heaven where your Divinity ſo journeth, into the frail Earth where my defects attach me; wherefore being not able but unjuſtly to addreſſe my heart to any but to your ſelf, ſince I have been wonderfully amourous of ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous a wonder as your ſelf, I have reſolved to make my heart come out of its place, and to offer it ſelf at your feet, although that it hath made ſuch general rebellions in my Iudgement and my Reaſon, who nevertheleſſe thought that at the laſt your attractions and my liberty would ſo ſhake hands, that my liberty would be enforced to render it ſelf your Captive. And you have now made ſuch ſtrong, viſible, and powerfull impreſſions on my Soul, that never Printer hath printed any leaf better than you have made an impreſſion on my heart with an indelible Character, and my Will receiving on it ſelf the Idoll of your monſtrous beauties, doth greatly advance the Honour of your Houſe. For this cauſe you ſhall always have the Image of my affection before your eyes, and make nearer your approches to ſee how innumerable they are. Pluck yours from your heart if you pleaſe to keep company with mine, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict no more my quiet, as heretofore you have done.</p>
            <p>This goodly Oration being ended, <hi>Fremond</hi> replyed unto him in neat and <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59287:50"/>quick language, that ſhe believed ſhe had not the power to captivate ſo gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant a Spirit as was his, but ſhe believed that he counterfeited for the moſt part, to find a Subject whereon to exerciſe his Eloquence. Ah Deereſt Star (ſaid he) you know not that you are already mounted on high above the Horizon of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, and that the miracle of your perfections, and the perfection of your miracles, with a ſoft violence have wounded my bleeding Soul. O Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſell, as fair as you are cruell, and as cruell as you are fair, you do much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble that treacherous Emperour <hi>Nero,</hi> who took pleaſure to ſee the City of
<hi>Rome</hi> on fire, for from the Turret of your merits you with delight behold not only the Suburbs, but even the City of my heart to burn, with all the Churches in it, which I have dedicated to your Honour; Know you not Lady, that an Antient did ſpeak this beautifull Sentence, <hi>Amoris vulnus idem qui facit ſanat.</hi> Recover then a poor dying man, I ſhall otherwiſe ſing with the Poet <hi>Properti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> whom you know to be a good Author, and without reproach, <hi>Solus Amor morbi non cupit Artificem.</hi> In purſuance of this he did utter ſo many broken pieces of Latin, that I believe he brought up all that which was within the ſink of his Common Places under the title of Love. <hi>Fremond</hi> without making ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence that ſhe found any impertinence in his diſcourſe, did liſten attentively to him, and withall did anſwer him as favourably as he could deſire, which was the reaſon that he thus followed his Sute; Why then more fair than
<hi>Venus,</hi> than <hi>Venus</hi> of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> whatſoever Oration that miſerable and paſſive I can make in the way of Demonſtration, and whatſoever Syllogiſm can flow from my mouth, you cannot but thereby acknowledge that I am your Superlative Servant <hi>per omnes caſus.</hi> You were not born to ſerve Sir (ſaid <hi>Fremond</hi> to him) there is no Maid ſo ambitious whatſoever ſhe be that will take upon her the quality to be your Miſtreſſe; for my ſelf I ſhould be happy to aſſume that of Slave. On that, <hi>Hortenſius</hi> made Replyes, which for pleaſantneſſe of conceit were beyond all compariſon, and the diſcourſes of all the Pedants in the world are not to be valued with them, for he powred forth at once all the beſt phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the Latin Tongue, and did aſſiſt himſelf with no ſmall number of Greek Proverbs, with which he interlarded his diſcourſe. I leave you to judge if <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> did underſtand all that which he did ſpeak.</p>
            <p>She who received all the offers of his ſervice in deriding them according to her cuſtom, did not ſtick to aſſure him, that within few days ſhe would come to give him a viſit, and would bring with her but two Neighbours that were Citizens, and if it were poſſible the young Advocate (that made love unto her) who ſhe ſaid, was her Coſin German.
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> having notice of the day when the Queen of his heart would come unto his lodgings, did make great preparations, Love having made him prodigall. He would willingly lay forth halt of his yearly penſion to make a ſumptuous collation. I was of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that he would not have my Company, and therefore to make ſure work I reſolved to make uſe of the opportunity. A Bottle of Muſcadell, and another of Hippocras were in his Study, which did moſt ſtrongly tempt me, but what means was there to obtain them? Invention did aſſiſt me with a ſuddain Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, in which apprehenſion I entred into the Chamber of <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> where obſerving him to read in a Book of a great bulk, I looked upon the Title to ſee what it conteined. It was a large Treatiſe of the State and power of the Turk; Behold here a good Book, ſaid he, I now have learned that which I did not know before. It is good to live, and to obſerve all things. I do find that no man doth ever turn his Poſteriors to the great Emperour who ſits in the ſeat of
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> and whoſoever departs from him he muſt goe backwards, although he were the Ambaſſadour of <hi>France;</hi> Do you remember this, Truant, ſaid he? Goe and write it down preſently in your Table Book: It is excellent indeed ſaid I, and ſmiled, for ſince I found that he was amorous, I thought my ſelf as great a Maſter as himſelf, and ſeeing his Study open I made but one ſtep into <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59287:51"/>it. What doe you within there, ſaid he, unto me? I replyed, I would look one word Sir, in your
<hi>Ovid;</hi> It is in the corner of the little table, ſaid he. I had nothing to do with <hi>Ovid,</hi> howſoever the better to manage my deſign, I took it up, and finding the bottle of <hi>Hypocras,</hi> which was too bigg to hide in my breeches, I tyed it faſt unto me with a point behind me, and proceeding in my admirable Invention, I came forth, holding <hi>Ovid</hi> in my hand, and going ſtill backwards and backwards, I ſaid to my Maſter, who at that preſent had his eys fixed on his Book; Sir, I have ſo great a deſire to retain in my Memory the Reverence which is ſhewed to the great Turk, that at this time I will go from you as if you were he; I then did go backwards to the door in all the poſtures of a Mimick, which cauſed him to laugh; and having in this manner ſtoll'n his bottle, I did open it in my ſtudy, where I took ſome hearty draughts, but for fear that I ſhould meet him when he ſhould be in the height of his Fury having diſcover'd my theft, I preſently returned to his Chamber, and demanded leave of him to go forth, which being obtained with a loud <hi>Exeat,</hi> I took my bottle along with me under my gown, and did empty it with a young Scholar of the City who was my friend; After that, I did goe to look out <hi>Fremond,</hi> with whom I feared not to return into the College, becauſe I knew ſhe was as able to appeaſe the choler of <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> as a glaſſe of water is able to qualifie the heat of a glaſſe of wine.</p>
            <p>She had but two neighbours in her company as ſhe had promiſed, with whom ſhe came unto <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> not at the great Gate of the College, but at the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>After ſome amorous entertainment, he took a pen in his hand, and wrote certain verſes on a Paper in the praiſe of his Miſtreſſe. One of the Citizens that were the companions of <hi>Fremond</hi> did praiſe the Verſes, but remembring that ſhe had ſeen the ſame lines amongſt the Works of a Modern Poet, when ſhe obſerved him ſometimes to ſtand in a great pauſe, ſometimes to ſcratch his head, and bite his nayls, and ſometimes to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>amp on the ground, as if he had been in labour to finiſh thoſe Stanzaes, which he feigned to compoſe, ſhe ſpake unto him by way of upbraiding, Sir, If you have forgot what doth follow, I will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate it unto you; write it down, for I have it by heart, It is but yeſterday ſince I did read that piece in a Book which was preſented to me. I believe not ſo (ſaid <hi>Hortenſius</hi>) it came intirely from my Muſe. I will rehearſe unto you what follows, ſaid the Citizens Wife, and you ſhall find that it will anſwer to that which you have already written. Having then repeated the Verſes to him word for word, ſhe was not ſo contented, but entred into his ſtudy, and made ſo diligent a ſearch, that at length ſhe found the Book, by the likeneſſe it had unto her own, where ſhe ſhewed to <hi>Hortenſius</hi> the ſame Verſes which he had written; but he would not ſeem to underſtand her, but aſſured her that he was the Author, and vainly would perſwade her, that his Genius was like unto that of the Poets, and did jump with him in the ſame thoughts and in the ſame words: And have you not heard, ſaid he, That there is nothing ſpoken, which hath not been ſpoken hertofore? And yet I find ſome difference here; for I have made <hi>Fremonda,</hi> and he hath wrote
<hi>Clorinda;</hi> in one place I have wrote <hi>charms,</hi> and he hath wrote
<hi>attractions;</hi> in the beginning of my third Stanza, you find, <hi>I do not ſee,</hi> and in the ſame place in his you ſhall read, <hi>I ſee not.</hi> Thus did <hi>Hortenſius</hi> imploy his head to excuſe his theft, which was greater than mine who did ſteal his bottle; but it did no more cover his fault, than the throwing on of a net doth cover a naked man; and although at that time they did forbear openly to deride him, yet ſince in divers companies it hath made ſport enough: But when I th nk of the Citizens Wife, If after ſeeing his firſt Stanza, ſhe had immediately retired her ſelf, and not looked upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and when he had done writing, if ſhe had rehearſed the whole Poem, as <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59287:51"/>ſhe had it in her Memory, one undoubtedly would believe that ſhe was ſome great So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cereſſe, thinking ſhe had divined that which <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was come at the ſame time to compoſe.</p>
            <p>This Invention being not then in her mind, ſhe made uſe of that which I have related to you, which was as good, and our Pedant, to cauſe her to forget it, did begin immediately to take the diſhes in his hand, and to charge the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with an honeſt Collation. There was no more want of Confects dry or wet, than there is want of water in a River, nevertheleſſe the Bottle of <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cras</hi> was wanting, and becauſe it could not be found, they muſt content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Muſcadel only.
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> would not make it apparent that the ſtealing away of one of his bottles could put him into a diſtemper; becauſe, you muſt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As he continued this diſcourſe, the young Advocate who loved
<hi>Fremond</hi> did enter into the Room, with two of his friends, and two female Citizens more, and thoſe the moſt pleaſant ones in all the City. Sir, ſaid the Advocate, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome buſineſs with Madamoiſelle
<hi>Fremond,</hi> we have made bold to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your houſe, for which I doe deſire you that you would excuſe us. <hi>Fremond</hi> interrupted him, and ſaid, I aſſure my ſelf that Mr. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> is very glad of your comming, and is not ſorry at all, unleſſe it be that you are come too late to his Collation; whereupon one of the Company ſaid, there is yet a little of the Muſcadel left. <hi>Salva pace,</hi> ſaid the Uſher. Well, well, ſaid <hi>Hortenſius</hi> to him. Go, and give order to my Friend the Victualler, to ſend me the beſt piece of Roaſt-meat that he he hath. He ſpake theſe words, becauſe he ſaw it was very late, and that thoſe who came laſt had brought a Fidler with them: he therefore imagined that in Civility he muſt give a Supper to them all, and the rather, becauſe that ſome of them had continued there a long time, nevertheleſs it did not grieve him, becauſe they appeared to him to be people of ſo good a Temper, that he could do no leſſe than buy their Company.</p>
            <p>As the Uſher was going out of doors, I deſired him to take me along with him; for having my liberty but ſeldom, I was glad to take the opportunity to go into the City upon any occaſion whatſoever. He was ſo pleaſant at that time, that he readily granted what I deſired; for he was glad that all the world <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59287:52"/>ſhould take notice of the power he had over me; we did therefore goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Victualler, but we found nothing there that pleaſed us, and drank only a Glaſſe or two of wine. We were adviſed to goe ſo far as the Cooks at the little bridge. The Vſher there did buy a Capon, and deſiring to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him a piece of roſted Beef, he did goe amongſt all the Cooks, and could find no piece according to his mind. I obſerved a Cooks Wife who ſeemed to me to be a very handſom Woman, and I addreſſed my ſelf to her to make my Market, ſhe was newly marryed, and did not well underſtand what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to her trade. I demanded of her the price of her roſt beef, ſhe ſaid, Four and twenty Souſe, which was thrice as much as it was worth. An Aſſes pizzle, ſaid I, and ſpeaking that word did goe out of doors. Her Husband perceiving that ſhe did drive her Cuſtomers from his Shop by putting too high a price upon his meat, did ſay unto her, I know not what you mean, to ask ſo dear for what is to be ſold, if you uſe to do in this manner I ſhall ſell nothing at all; Call back the boy again; His wife deſiring to make amends for her fault, and believing that an Aſſes pizzle was ſome new kind of coyn which ſhe never had heard of before, did call me back as loud as ſhe could, and ſaid unto me, Honeſt Cuſtomer will you not give me an Aſſes Pizzle and a half?</p>
            <p>The caprichiouſneſſe of the conceit did make me laugh ſo heartily, that I cannot remember I ever heard any thing that gave me more content. I retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to her ſhop being overcome with the exceſſe of laughter, and ſaid unto him, I will give her two Aſſes Pizzles if ſhe will; but her Husband approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me did ſpeak in paſſion, Goe too, Goe too, you are a very wagg, that which ſhe ſaid was not out of wantoneſſe but miſpriſion. Another time ſhe will be even with you; Give me twelve Souſe. On thoſe words the Uſher came, who gave him ten Souſe with which he was contented, and we returned to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege with our bargain.</p>
            <p>After I had made the Company laugh at the Account which faithfully I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to them, they all ſate down to the Table to Supper, but the Ladies who aſſiſted at the Collation would not eat, but
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> ſo laid about him that his Teeth did rattle again in his head. O what a brave ſight it was to ſee how artificially he did gnaw the Legg of the Capon, turning his head on that ſide where <hi>Fremond</hi> ſate, and gogling with his eyes to give her an amorous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard; but it was a better ſight to obſerve how I ſtood behind <hi>Fremond</hi> to receive from her thoſe morſels which did pleaſe me better than my ordinary penſion. Supper being ended they made the Fidler to play all ſorts of Dances, and the young men that were preſent did ſhew the diſpoſition of their Bodies to the ſound of that agreeable inſtrument. At the laſt being weary with that exerciſe, they preſented ſome other ſports with which the Ladies were much delighted.</p>
            <p>And after ſo many and ſo different paſtimes that it is impoſſible to repeat them all, I ſhall only acquaint you, that (in good earneſt) they played topſy turvy excellently well, for there was not a book in all the Study which in deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they had not thrown on the ground, and they did not ſpare ſo much as the foul Linnen, which according to the cuſtom of the College was in a corner of the Chamber. Every one took a piece, and folding it hard up, they did throw it at the head of <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> who asked them what was the Game they played at, and defended himſelf very untowardly. At laſt they told him there muſt be no denyal, for he muſt dance with <hi>Fremond</hi> to the muſick of the Violl. He did readily accord unto it, howſoever he would not pull off his Caſſock, not that he was afraid it ſhould be ſtollen from him, as a provident Gallant whom I know, who danceth always with his long Coat on, for fear it ſhould be ſtollen from him, but becauſe that he would not have it ſeen that his Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet wanted two or three Skirts, and was torn in ſeveral places, ſome of which were mended with ſtuff of one colour, and ſome of another. But what reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſoever he did make it would not ſerve his turn; for he was inforced to <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59287:52"/>put off that reverend coverture of his poverty. It was no ſmall paſtime to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the turn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and the paſſes he made, and the Capers he did cut; I conceive they were the ſame that <hi>Socrates</hi> practiſed when he had a curioſity to learn to dance, a little before his death. In the mean time one of the young men did put on his Caſſock, and covered his head with his ſquare cap, which <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> ſeeing did aſſure him, that in that habit he was very like the Principal of the College; whereupon another demanded of him what a kind of man was the Principal? I will tell you, ſaid he, He is a man of merit, but that he makes me pay too much for the rent of my Chambers, he ſpoke alſo ſomething worſe of him, as being of a detracting ſpirit, eſpecially againſt thoſe who ſucked the Marrow out of his purſe.</p>
            <p>On thoſe words he took a Baſe Violl from the teſtern of his Bed, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading himſelf that he could play well thereon, he had a deſire to charm the ears of his Miſtreſſe. The Fidler by chance knew the ſame Ayr which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to jarr upon, and <hi>Hortenſius</hi> conſorting with him of his own accord did ſay unto the Company, You ought to dance ſome Mask to the tune which our inſtruments doe play. What perſonages ſhall we repreſent, ſaid <hi>Fremond?</hi> Let the Gentleman (ſaid he) who hath on my Caſſock perſonate the Principal within, and doe you and the reſt of the Company take the Gowns in the next chamber of thoſe whom I teach, and act the parts of Scholars; Mr. Principal doe you take the rods which are made faſt to yonder matt, you ſhall ſcourge your Companions by turns one after another. The Company being gone out of his Chamber into the next to attire themſelves, did find that it was very late, and determined all of them to goe home without bidding good night, giving him leave to ſcrape his belly full on his Violl; I did go into the Chamber where
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> was playing, to bring away the Cloaks of the Men, and the Muffs of the Women, making him believe that they would conduce the better to diſguiſe them, and having brought them all unto them, I did let them forth at the back door, the Uſher who was imployed another way having left me the Keys; Afterward I returned to my Study, and made faſt the door, as if I had not ſtirred out of it all that Evening.</p>
            <p>The Principal was by that time in the Court, and walked the round with a great Lanthorn before him. He heard the Violl and the Fiddle that played to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and could not imagine who they were that made the moſt untunable muſick in the world, for the two inſtruments were not of the ſame found, and did not follow one another, and our Maſter did often ſtrike on thoſe ſtrings which he ought not to touch, and almoſt at every ſtroke did miſtake one for another, taking <hi>C</hi> for <hi>B</hi> and <hi>D</hi> for
<hi>C.</hi> The Principal ſtanding cloſe to the Wall did liſten attentively, and heard <hi>Hortenſius</hi> who cryed out as loud as he could, Why do you ſtay ſo long? Enter Mr. Principal, make haſt and bring in your Mask with you. The Principal believed that he did ſpeak to him, and that he had ſeen him out of his Window, wherefore he did goe up the ſtairs, and his train with him, as well to know what he had to ſay unto him, as to underſtand if there were any marriage there or not; He was in the entry to his Chamber when <hi>Hortenſius</hi> cryed out again, <hi>Festina</hi> Principal, you make me weary to attend you, I will make a hard ſhift but I will dance the Mask my ſelf, if you will not enter the ſooner, and ſtriking the Fiddler on his fingers with his Fiddle ſtick, O good man (ſaid he) play me the dance which the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> danced at their Sacrifices, or the Saraband which the <hi>Cretians</hi> of <hi>Saturn,</hi> for fear the great Glutton ſhould hear the cry of the little child, and devour him as he did the reſt. The Fidler who did not underſtand his language did continue playing on as he did before, wherefore <hi>Hortenſius</hi> being in a great choler did ſtrike him harder than he did before, which made the Fiddler to cry out as loud as he could. The Principal ſtood near unto the door, and liſtned <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59287:53"/>to all this, but his Curioſity cauſed him now to enter, and to demand of our Maſter, What Devils dance is it that you would have me to dance? What is the ſport that you are making here Maſter <hi>Hortenſius?</hi> Vertue of God, I think you are little better than drunk? O good Sir, be not angry, ſaid <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> I have not drank ſo hard but I know the Principal well enough; I have made a feaſt for ſome of my friends, with whom I am a little merry: it was not to you to whom I did ſpeak, it was to one of thoſe who was to enter with his
<hi>Cymmerian</hi> Mummery, which he hath undertaken to bring in with the reſt of his Society. But where are theſe people of whom you ſpeak? ſaid the Principal. They are attiring themſelves in my Scholars chamber, ſaid
<hi>Hortenſius.</hi> The Principal immediately entred into their chamber, and finding not any one there, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd and ſaid unto him, I believe you are not well in your wits, and that you imagine you have a great Company, when you are alone by your ſelf; Lord I what a diſorder have you made in your chamber? here is ſuch a confuſion, as if all the hoggs in the Town had been here: ſee here good <hi>Seneca!</hi> and how other Authors of the Latin tongue doe lie bedabled amongſt the ordures; and ſpeaking thoſe words, he did take up divers Books which they had thrown down in the height of their debauchment. And you Mr. Fidler, for your part, I ſhall inforce you with baſtinadoes to tell me from whence you doe come, and what you have to doe in my College? Peradventure it is your good melody that hath made this honeſt man to loſe his underſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who (before having not his Equal in Eloquence) was indeed a Phoenix. O good Sir, pardon me, ſaid the Fidler, I did not come but as I was led, my poor ſight is loſt: A man, whom I know not, brought me hither, and hath ſent back my eyes to my houſe, telling them, that I ſhould have no need of them untill to morrow morning, at which time he would ſend them to me. What do you mean by your eyes, ſaid the Principal? I ſo call the poor Boy that leads me, ſaid the Fidler, He told me once in the ſtreet that he ſaw me, and he being a poor Boy I received him into my Imagination, as if I had ſeen him alſo. O good Jeſus, I would he was here, that I might lye ſomewhere elſe than in this place, where ſo much miſchief is done me. But even now I asked for a little drink, and they gave me a glaſſe whoſe foot was all beſcumber'd, and although the ill ſavour did much diſpleaſe me, yet the great thirſt I had did inforce me to lift it to my mouth, which gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily opening it ſelf to receive it, I ſwallowed a great deal of Urine which was in it, before I could well taſt whether it was wine or not. But that is not all, This goodly Muſician that playes with me hath beaten me into plaiſter, which (after a world of Latin he hath ſpoken to me) did afflict as much my ſoul, as his blows have done my Body. O you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſoever you are that doe ſpeak unto me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I doe believe that you know me well, becauſe you have made mention of the Sign of the Tap-houſe where I lodge, which is the <hi>Phoenix;</hi> Lead me home, I pray you, and I will give you half a Souze. Make no ſuch offers nor intreaties to me, ſaid the Principal, I am only angry here with my Friend, you have not eyes to ſee who I am, Look out ſome other Guide. During this diſcourſe, <hi>Hortenſius</hi> did begin to put his Houſe in order, and the Fidler taking him by the arm, ſaid unto him, Hear you Sir, I have played all this Evening, and was promiſed a Quarde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue for my pains, Give it me Sir? Ah my Friend, ſaid <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> Have not you taken as much contentment to hear me play on the Violl, as I have done to hear you play on your Fiddle, and doe I demand any money of you for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence? Oh, But you have danced Sir, ſaid the Fidler, and you cannot ſay that your dancing did give me any pleaſure; and it is no reaſon that I ſhould pay for it; for I cannot ſee at all. Let thoſe pay thee then, that did imploy thee, ſaid
<hi>Hortenſius;</hi> Thou canſt ſhow nothing of thy work, it is all vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into air, and yet thou would'ſt have ſome real and ſenſible ſalary, and feel a Quardecue to fall with weight into thy pocket. See here the miſery of this Age, ſaid the Fidler. Alas, alas, Our Eſtate is not eſteem'd as it hath been, I have <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59287:53"/>known the dayes when a dozen of them would fall thicker into this powch, than two of them do now. I have played before Kings in my dayes, and they have ſet me at the upper end of the Table. Comfort your ſelf my friend, ſaid the Principal, I will pay you. But Mr. <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> VVill you retain the Salary of this poor Man? Tell me, what Fancy moved you to play with him? Have I not told you already, ſaid <hi>Hortenſius?</hi> I will ſee what is become of my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſpeaking thoſe words, he took the Candle, and did look over all his lodgings. The Principal knocking at our Studies, demanded of us, If there had bin any with our Maſter? we made anſwer that we knew nothing, to ſhew unto him that we followed our Books with ſuch eager diligence, that we had no thought at all of thoſe indifferent things which paſſed in his Lodging. I know not what to think of it (ſaid <hi>Hortenſius</hi>) coming back from his inqueſt, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not meet with any one. Goe to bed, and take your Reſt, ſaid the Principal, you have need of it, for he believed he had loſt his ſenſes. I will take the Fidler along with me, who ſhall lie this night in my lodgings, for fear you ſhould make a new quarrel, or being at peace one with another, you ſhould begin your Muſick again. Having ſpoken thoſe words, he took the poor Man along with him, to whom he gave ſome monies which he received from my Maſter. They being departed,
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> came to me, and demanded of me, Whither <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> and her Companions were gone? I made him believe, that being adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed that the Principal was come into our Lodgings, ſhe deſired me to open the back door to return that way, fearing he ſhould ſee her, and that all her company followed her. He then demanded of me where was his Caſſock? I told him, that he who was to act the Principal had taken it along with him, and ſaid, that he would come in the morning to give a Breakfaſt to him, and all the Company that were with him. Ah <hi>Jupiter</hi> thou God of Hoſpitality I ſaid <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> Thou haſt ſeen how I have honoured thy Deity, I have gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly entertained my Gueſts, and thereupon they will as gallantly entertain me.</p>
            <p>In this humor he did go to bed, and early in the morning he was viſited by all the Pedants of the College, who came to ſee if he were reſtored to his ſenſes, which the Principal aſſured them he had loſt. He had ſo well digeſted his Wine in the night, that they found him in that ſober temper in which he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to be; nevertheleſſe they did not forbear to make ſport with him for his Muſick. After dinner he gave me a charge to goe to <hi>Fremond,</hi> to deſire her to ſend him back his Caſſock. <hi>Fremond</hi> did reſolve to write a Letter to him, in which ſhe acquainted him, that ſhe acknowledged his affection, which was very agreeable to her, but his condition did diſpleaſe her; for although her Father was but an Advocate, yet he was deſcended of a noble Family, and that ſhe would not eſpouſe a Man who at leaſt was not noble by his Vertues, and did not make profeſſion of Arms. Therefore the Caſſock ſhould not be reſtored to him, becauſe he muſt wear a ſword if he would obtain that of her which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that he ſo much deſired.</p>
            <p>Having read this Epiſtle, which was a definitive Sentence, he anſwered her Letter with another, in which he repreſented, that his Deſign was alwayes to make himſelf an Advocate, thinking it would be agreeable to her to have a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of the ſame Condition as was her Father; that ſhe did ill to undervalue Men of Learning, who, no doubt, were more noble than Men of Arms; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, ſince it was her pleaſure, he would take to the Sword, although the Profeſſion which he had alwayes followed, did no wayes derogate from the Nobility of her Anceſtors, which by proofs he would make apparent to her. All this was intermingled with Sentences, Proverbs, Examples, and Authorities, in a more than a barbarous confuſion, which was ſo uneaſie to unintangle, that the Advocate and four of his Friends who were all lettered Men, did imploy a whole afternoon about it, and yet could not make their explications, but by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59287:54"/>
               <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was as much loſt in love as a man could be, and to ſpeak the truth the cauſe of his paſſion did deſerve it ſhould be ſo. He reſolved with himſelf to perform what he had promiſed, and knowing that if he ſhould arm his ſide with a Sword, and be ſudenly compleat in the habit of a Souldier, it would ſeem ſtrange to thoſe who were acquainted with the whole courſe of his education, he thought it more expedient by little and little to accuſtome him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto it. To this purpoſe he did one day put on a pair of Boots, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the City he told all his friends he did meet with, that on the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he was to take his journey into <hi>Normandy</hi> which was his native Country, he cauſed alſo the ſame report to be noyſed in the College; Nevertheleſſe, he did not depart till four days afterwards, and left a Subſtitute to have a care of his Scholars in his abſence: Being returned he lodged abroad, and not in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and left not off his Sword or his Boots, but made his long Cloak ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and metamorphoſed his Caſſock into a Doublet cut upon his Shirt, he did wear every day a Band with a Bonelace on it, and had nothing of a Pedant but the Diſcourſe only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fremond</hi> having ſeen him in this Equipage, did profeſſe unto him that he infinitely pleaſed her, but ſhe could not be entirely contented, if he did not ſhew her the proofs of the antiquity of his Nobility, which he vaunted that he could. Being brought to this extremity, he diligently ſought after the means to maintain ſo falſe a Title, and having underſtood that a good old man, a Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his was in
<hi>Paris,</hi> he took the pains to look him out, and deſired him to witneſſe that he knew hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Father, and that he lived always in his Country in the reputation of a Gentleman. The old man being a very honeſt man told him, that being ſo near as he was to render unto God an Account of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he could not be induced to be a witneſſe to an untruth for all the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence he did promiſe him, neither did he now deſire any reward, for he looked after a more ſure poſſeſſion than the goods of this world.
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> replyed, that on every demand that ſhould be propounded to him, he would provide him with ſuch amphibological anſwers, that although they were nothing but the truth, yet they ſhould conduce much to prove that which he deſired. The Countryman ſaid unto him, If it be ſo, he had met with a man from whom he ſhould receive all manner of contentment. Go too then, ſaid <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> My Father was as good a Gentleman as thou art, and if thou ſhalt affirm that he was noble, thou ſhalt nor lie at all, for thou haſt not the Spirit of a Clown, and no more had he. I will ſhew thee how. If the Rent of one hundred thouſand Crowns had been given to you both, you would not have addicted your ſelves to Mechanick exerciſes to which poverty did compell your Spirits, you would have eaten without doing any thing, and you would have lived the whole courſe of your life without doing any thing, which is to be noble. The will which you have ought to be reputed for the deed, and in affirming this you commit not the fourth part of the leaſt Venial Sin; And ſo much in ſpeaking on the firſt propoſition. If the ſecond be propounded to you, which is, if my Father hath ſerved the King in his wars, you may aſſure him that he hath; for truly I remember that in Winter nights by the fire ſide, he hath told my Mother that in his youth he was ſomething wild, during the troubles at that time in
<hi>France,</hi> and as a Souldiers boy he did ſerve a younger Brother, who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Company of Foot in the Kings Service, now ſince he did ſervice to a man who fought for the King, there is no man can deny but that he did it to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty himſelf; and what, though he was no Captain, nor General of the Army, men are not to be blamed that they doe not all of them arrive to that height of Honours, for we are not all the Favourits of Fortune.</p>
            <p>The Countryman accorded to ſerve <hi>Hortenſius</hi> as a Witneſſe in this affair, being induced to it by his good reaſons. The firſt time afterwards that the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſaw <hi>Fremond,</hi> he deſired her that ſhe would be pleaſed to aſſign a day to <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59287:54"/>give him a meeting in any houſe ſhe would appoint, where he might fully declare his mind unto her. On the day appointed he came with his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the Servant for additions, whom he commanded to keep himſelf all-ways behind him, and when he numbred any acres or ſums of money which he had, to ſtep forth and take the word with confidence out of his mouth, and make it twice as much, to the end that on the one ſide they might judge ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely to his advantage, and on the other, that he might be taken for a modeſt man, and without the leaſt ſhadow of vanity, who made his eſtate leſſe than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fremond</hi> was in the ſame houſe with her who was the Miſtreſs of it, &amp; did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her unto the College. The young Advocate whom ſhe called Coſen, was alſo there, becauſe ſhe ſaid that ſhe would firſt communicate to him the Sute of <hi>Hortenſius</hi> before ſhe would acquaint her Father with it. There were beſide two other brave Companions, and fit to be preſent at ſuch a conference. Our Pedant did firſt of all entertain his Miſtreſſe with the Diſcourſe of Love, according to his cuſtome, and when he ſaw that ſhe did put him in mind of his promiſes, and deſired to be aſſured if he had means enough to maintain her in the condition of a Gentlewoman, he began to diſcover his eſtate with the greateſt imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in the world. Monſieur (ſaid he) (addreſſing himſelf particularly to her Coſin, who had thruſt himſelf into their company) to the end that you may not conceive me to be any contemptible fellow, underſtand that in my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try I have the poſſeſſion of a houſe worth two thouſand Crowns. His Servant for additions who ſtood behind him, ſtepped forth, and according to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts with a great confidence ſaid unto him, Nay Sir, it is well worth four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns. Ho, ſaid <hi>Hortenſius</hi> turning aſide to him, muſt you take up your Maſter? If I ſhould make it leſſe you ought not ſirrah to gainſay me. Moreover, ſaid he, I have a Conſtitution of three thouſand Liuvres due to a Denier, and the perſon that ows it me is very able to pay it. Nay it is ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Liuvres, ſaid his Servant for additions, I have ſeen the Contract, and the Bonds to confirm it. Wilt thou not yet hold thy peace thou beggarly fellow? ſaid
<hi>Hortenſius;</hi> His Servant for additions replyed, Yes Sir, but it is requiſite that I doe put you in mind of that which you forget.</p>
            <p>On that the Gentlewoman of the houſe, who was a Companion of
<hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,</hi> did acquaint <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> that there was a report that he had ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and if it were ſo ſhe would not counſell
<hi>Fremond</hi> to eſpouſe him. He made anſwer, they are Slanderers who do make this report unto you; I am here before one; to whom I would no more appear a Lyer, than before the Divinity it ſelf, I therefore ſwear that I have neither blain nor blemiſh in all my Body, but only what a hot Iron made by an accident in my left Legg. His Servant for additions believing that he was to multiply what his Maſter ſaid, according to his inſtructions, Sir, ſaid he, you have one like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it on you right Legg. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> being angry did riſe from his Chair to ſtrike his Groom, and to puniſh him for his indiſcretion, but they retained him, and his Servant for additions believed that his paſſion was but counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited as before, and therefore determined with himſelf to perform again his office on the firſt opportunity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fremond</hi> then ſaid unto <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> we may collect as well by yours as by your Servants words, that you are worth eighteen thouſand Liuvres, but we underſtand by ſome perſons of credit that you owe ten thouſand, part whereof you have borrowed to aſſiſt you in the purchaſe of your houſe, and the other part to ſupply your neceſſities. Thoſe who told you ſo, replyed <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> did miſ-inform you. Pardon me (anſwered <hi>Fremond</hi>) If you pleaſe that we ſhall hold you for a Frank man, you cannot deny a thing which is apparent to us. Being then unwilling to diſſemble with his Miſtreſſe, and imagining it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to aſſure her that he was worth eight thouſand Franks, he ſaid unto <pb n="16" facs="tcp:59287:55"/>her, Since it is your pleaſure, that I ſhould ſay after you, I do confeſſe that I am in debt Ten thouſand liuvers. His Servant for additions incontinently replyed, Nay Sir, to my knowledge you owe Twenty thouſand. How? ſaid <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> riſing up, Doſt thou not ſee how thou goeſt beyond thy Commiſſion? and whiſpering him in the ear, he told him, he did not ſpeak now of Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but of a Debt, and did not I, ſaid he, inſtruct thee to multiply the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions only? to thoſe words he added four or five blowes with his fiſt, which had been followed with others, if his choler were not reſtrained. When he was ſate down again, <hi>Fremond</hi> ſaid unto him, Although you pretended to be rich, I doe find you indigent, for if you have Eighteen Thouſand Franks, you doe owe Twenty thouſand; and I perceive well enough you doe not ſo much deſire to marry a Wife, as to meet with a good portion to relieve you in the neceſſities of your Age.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak the truth, he was worth three thouſand Crowns, which he had gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by paring our portions, in performing the office of a Regent in ſeveral Forms, and by ſome other particular advantages; nevertheleſſe he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make <hi>Fremond</hi> believe it, nor any of her Company, who were all inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and would give no credence, but to thoſe words only which his Servant for additions had delivered. Howſoever <hi>Fremond</hi> ſaid, that if he were of a good Family, as he pretended to be, peradventure ſhe would not ſo much regard his poverty. Oh Madamoiſell, I have here a witneſſe of it, ſaid he, and cauſing the Countryman to approach, he proceeded, Behold here an honeſt and a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Man, to whom I do referr my ſelf. Hear you then my Friend (ſaid the Kinſman of
<hi>Fremond</hi>) We deſire to know, if the Father of Maſter
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> was noble, or no; What ſay you? I know very well that he was, ſaid the Countryman. And his Grandfather alſo, ſaid the Advocate? He was ſo, ſaid the Countryman. Sir, Have you any Patents to ſhew for it, ſaid the Advocate to <hi>Hortenſius?</hi> No, ſaid he; for ſince my Anceſtors have advanced themſelves by their Vertues, we need not any Patents from the King. The generous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my Progenitors, which without diſcontinuance have declared themſelves to all the world, have made themſelves known even unto Envy, and if in thoſe days they had been recorded in Letters, they had before this time been defaced by age, or conſumed by Rats. I do believe you, ſaid the Advocate. But you honeſt Man (ſaid he) ſpeaking to the Countryman, Tell me if the Father of Monſieur was ever in the Warrs during his life? Yes Sir, (ſaid he) I dare aſſure you. The Advocate replyed, Being returned to his Houſe from the wars, did he alwaies wear a ſword, as the badge of his Condition? The Countryman found himſelf to be here ſurprized; for <hi>Hortenſius</hi> had not inſtructed him how be ſhould anſwer to ſuch a Propoſition, without ſpeaking an untruth; in the end he told him, that he had alwaies ſeen him wear a great Whittle, and of a good length at his girdle, and ſaid moreover, that he did never goe out of doors without one Iron Inſtrument or other; What Iron Inſtrument, ſaid the Advocat, it poſſibly might be a Spade? No, Sir, ſaid the Countryman, it was a Gleave, being unwilling to uſe the name of Sword or Whittle. Did he live like a Man of quality, ſaid the Advocate? How many doggs did he keep? None but one, anſwered the other. What dogg was that? A great Maſtiff, replyed the Countryman. He did not go a hunting then, ſaid the Advocate? Once, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the Countryman, I ſaw him hunt the Wolf who devoured his ſheep, and to ſhow his valour, at one blow he killed him with his Sheep-hook. This laſt is the moſt remarkable of all, ſaid the Advocate, and ſmiled; he made uſe of his Sheep-hook, when he ſhould have imployed his Harquebuze, and yet this Man had been a Souldier; But what did his Maſtiff do? He ſerved to keep his flock when ſometimes he abſented himſelf from them, being imployed in the making of ſmall Crucifixes of wood, and other little Figures; as well to avoid Idleneſſe, as to gain ſomething for the ſuſtenance of his life. At that they began to laugh
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59287:55"/>outright, which had been louder, had <hi>Hortenſius</hi> not been preſent, they all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to uſe him reſpectfully, that they might receive more pleaſure from him. As far then as we can learn, honeſt Friend, by your Diſcourſe (ſaid the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate) the Father of
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> did keep ſheep, and was conſtrained to work with his hands for his daily bread; but he need not to be aſhamed at it, ſaid the Advocate, and ſmiled to himſelf: for having read ſo much, he is not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that Princes ſometimes were Shepherds, and the Innocence and Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of that Condition is yet highly eſteemed. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> obſerving that the Error which the Countryman committed was unpardonable, was contented to affirm, that this Father was not the leſſe to be eſteemed, becauſe he kept a flock of Sheep: for being diſcharged of the tumults of the War, he believed he could not better reliſh the ſweetneſſe of peace in any other condition. But <hi>Fremond,</hi> drawing her mouth an inch and a half wider than ordinary, and mopping at him, aſſured him, that he might look him out a Wife ſomewhere elſe, and that ſhe would not have a Husband whoſe Father was of ſo baſe a quality, and that ſhe was afraid (for poſſibly <hi>Hortenſius</hi> had kept a herd of Swine in his youth) that in ſpeaking to her, he might believe that he was yet ſpeaking to his hoggs, and would uſe her, as he did uſe them; and that all the world, pointing at her with their finger, might ſay, Behold there where goes the young Sow Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſell!</p>
            <p>The diſdain hereof did put <hi>Hortenſius</hi> into ſuch a fury, that it proved a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Antidote againſt the poyſon of his love, which immediately he turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hate, and without ſaying <hi>Adieu</hi> to any one, he flung out of the Chamber, and made faſt the Door after him, for fear they ſhould fetch him back again. He came directly to the College to acquaint his Uſher with his misfortune. In the mean time the Countryman, and the Servant for additions, who ſtayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, were examined upon certain Interrogatories, and they found that this glorious Pedant did come almoſt ſtark naked to <hi>Paris,</hi> and was conſtrained to beg, until he had found a livelihood. His Servant for additions did think to return to him, but he diſmiſſed him when ever he ſaw him, as the folly he committed did deſerve, and the Countryman did go from him without a recompence, ſince he had deſtroyed all his Hopes.</p>
            <p>In the height of his Rage he did write a Letter to
<hi>Fremond,</hi> in which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed againſt her with a thouſand pedantick names; he called her <hi>Medea, Megera, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſiphone.</hi> He told her, that ſince ſhe would not be a Roſe, and be gathered by a Nourſling of the Muſes, who had drank more than one Bucket ful of the Fountain of
<hi>Aganippe,</hi> he deſired <hi>Phoebus</hi> to metamorphoſe her into a Thiſtle, that ſhe might ſerve to feed Aſſes; that he ſaw well enough by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who was transformed into a Swan, a Satyr, and a Bull, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light himſelf with his Miſtreſſes, that he muſt be a Beaſt who obtaineth any thing from a Woman, and eſpecially from her whom he eſteemed to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Woman in the world, that is to ſay, who had the greateſt part of that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and brutiſh humor which pertained to her Sex. Afterwards he came to reproaches, and to ſhew the greateſt baſeneſſe in the world, he reckoned the expences he had been at to entertain her and her Company, and aſſured her, that he would have ſaved that money, but that he was in hope to have eſpouſed her, and told her in the concluſion, That ſince he was fruſtrated of his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his Expectation was, that ſhe, and all thoſe whom he entertained, ſhould by turns give him the like feaſt one after another.</p>
            <p>I was the <hi>Mercury</hi> of this Miſſive; but I carried not the Charming Rod, which is a ſign of Peace, for I came to denounce War.
<hi>Fremond</hi> would civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have anſwered his outrages, to have alwaies enjoyed the extraordinary mirth of his Company. She did write unto him, that ſhe minded not the Injuries with which he defamed her, becauſe ſhe knew that he was prepoſſeſſed with paſſion, and that ſhe alwayes highly did eſteem him, by reaſon of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <pb n="18" facs="tcp:59287:56"/>but ſhe ſaid, ſhe could not make him her Husband, becauſe he was not of that quality which the preſent cuſtome of the age did require, which ſhe was inforced to follow, nevertheleſſe ſhe would always bear an honeſt affection to him to recompence his own; And for his Banquet there were none that ſhould be in his debt for it, for her Coſin ſhould feaſt him firſt, and afterwards all the reſt ſhould follow by turns.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hortenſius</hi> having read this Anſwer did throw it into the fire, affirming that he would have nothing to doe with the affections or the Feaſts of <hi>Fremond,</hi> and being more wiſe for the time to come, he did ſwear that he would indear himſelf no more to any Girles but the Muſes, who alſo do allure us becauſe they are of that deceitfull Sex. Although the Meſſage his old Miſtreſſe did ſend unto him was full of flatteries, yet he would never endure the frequentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her Company any more, nevertheleſſe he diſcontinued not to wear a Sword, and hath ever ſince lived on his Revenues, and what he hath gained by tranſlating ſome Books out of Latin into French, or by being a Corrector of the Preſſe. I finiſhed all the courſe of my ſtudies in the ſame College, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my penſion to the Uſher, where nothing arrived worthy of recital, but what already I have related to you, and the Vacations of the year of my Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy being come, I was commanded by my Father to take my leave of the College, and to return to <hi>Brittany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I was in my own Country I ſaw the end of all my happineſſe, I was perpetually vexed by being demanded in what Calling I would imploy my ſelf, my ears were furred with the importunate clamors and counſells of my friends, who would have me ſtudy Humanity, and the tedious Volumes of the Law, to be one of the Counſellers in Parlament; but opinions do change when age comes on, and my Father afterwards hated no men more than thoſe of the long Robe, as ſince he hath made it appear by one who married my Siſter. And my Mother deſirous to comply with him in all things, did ſeem to deſire as well as himſelf to have me a Counſellor of the Law.</p>
            <p>This did relliſh ſo ill with me, that it is impoſſible to repreſent it to you. At that time I declamed within my ſelf againſt the wickedneſſe of the Age, where the natural Laws are corrupted, and the moſt generous Spirits are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to take upon them a great charge to trouble their repoſe, and cannot live in Quiet, which is a bleſſing that is not denyed unto Beaſts. From day to day I delayed to learn that dangerous knowledge which I have always hated more than the plague, it being the cauſe of the greateſt part of our Vexations. Being on the point to forſake my Fathers houſe he did fall extremely ſick; In vain the Phyſicians round about him did their endeavour to recover him, ſo it was that he dyed, and left his Wife and Children much afflicted for ſo great a loſſe.</p>
            <p>After his death, my Mother who accorded with me in all things which I deſired, did leave off the Reſolution ſhe had taken to force me to take the long Robe, and becauſe I was a ſtranger in <hi>Brittany,</hi> being accuſtomed to the Air of <hi>Paris,</hi> I beſought her that ſhe would permit me to return thither; ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of me what I would do there; I replyed to her, that I would paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſome time in learning honeſt exerciſes, and that I would indeavour to put my ſelf in the ſervice of ſome Prince. My Brothers in Law did give their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice upon it, and repreſented to me that Fortune reign'd moſt imperiouſly at the Court, and ſhewed there the greateſt effects of her inconſtancy; And briefly, when I preſumed to be in the higheſt degree of all her favours, ſhe would throw me down into the bottom of deſpair. All this did not detere me, I had nothing in my head but the greatneſſe of the world. In the end they gave me leave to put in practice my intention. I returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> and lodged in the Univerſity which I could not forget. I was afterwards acquainted with a Man who had Chambers ready furniſhed, and took Penſioners, and I day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59287:56"/>repaired to a Player on the Lute, a Fencer, and a Dancer, to learn their art, ſo that one hour was to exerciſe my ſelf in one faculty, and the other in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; I imployed all the remainder of my time to read indifferently all manner of Books, and I learned more in three months than I did before in ſeven years in the College, when I heard thoſe Pedantick abſurdities which did ſo corrupt my judgement, that I believed all the Fables of the Poets to be true ſtories, and did conceive to my ſelf that there were Sylvans and Dryades in the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, Nayades in the Fountains, and Nereides in the Sea: Moreover I belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that whatſoever was ſpoken of transformations was true; and I never ſaw a Nightin gall but I believed it was the Kings Daughter of <hi>Thracia.</hi> Neither was I alone abuſed in this conceit; for I know a great many more, and ſome Maſters themſelves, who were of the ſame opinion.</p>
            <p>As theſe old Errors were chaſed out of my underſtanding, I filled it with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowledge, and ſetting my ſelf to review my notes of Philoſophy which our Regent had dictated unto me, I did confer them with the beſt Authors I could find, ſo that by my induſtry I was ſufficiently inſtructed in every Science, for a man that would not make a particular profeſſion of them.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of theſe various entertainments, I lived about a year in the greateſt ſolitude in the world, and very ſeldom did goe out of doors, and walked then no further than on the old Banks which were near unto my lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. I was only viſited by two or three young Gentlemen with whom I was acquainted. I remember that one day there came with them one of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whoſe name was <hi>Raymond,</hi> who ſome few days afterwards returned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any one in his company. Looking in my Coffer, after he was gone, I found my little Box empty, in which I had put at leaſt threeſcore Crowns, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that I left him alone in my Chamber, not ſuſpecting him to be ſo light finger'd as he was. When ever I ſaw him, I ſpoke openly unto him what I though, and we came to very ſharp words, which I followed with threats; In the end I demanded of him if our controverſies on the next morning ſhould be decided by the Sword, in ſome place out of the City? He anſwered me, that he could not then meet me, becauſe he was very early to go out of Town according to his promiſe to ſome of his Companions, with whom he was to travell into <hi>Flanders:</hi> The next day I ſought all over <hi>Paris</hi> for him, but could not find him, and ſince I never ſaw him, and do not know what is become of him.</p>
            <p>O how great was my grief of heart to have loſt my money, with which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have appareld my ſelf, being about to leave off my mourning habit! to write unto my Mother for more would be more hurtfull than profitable, for ſhe would not be perſwaded but that I had loſt it at play, and would have ſent me nothing but Reproofs. I received a Letter from her wherein ſhe repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that I was poorer than I thought my ſelf to be, and that my Father had left many debts to pay; She accuſed me alſo of negligence, that I had not look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out ſome place for my ſelf as? promiſed her at my departure. I was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therefore to wear an old gray Sute which I had, &amp; a Cloak of colour <hi>de roy,</hi> which had a long time lain by me. I was ſo ill accommodated, that there was none of any judgement but would have taken me for the Son of the brave Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Port. Nevertheleſſe I did goe abroad more often than before, ſuch a deſire had I at that time to underſtand how all things were governed in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which was a thought that never troubled me when I was in the College.</p>
            <p>On the day before St. <hi>Martins,</hi> I did repair to the Palace, where I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver but thrice before to buy Gloves. Being upon the ſtairs I ſaw a young man of my age coming down, of whom I had ſome knowledge when I was in the College, he was in a red Gown, I remembred that he had a good voice, and I believed that he was one of the Choriſters of the Chapel, and he paſſing by, I had no more thought of him in that Relation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59287:57"/>Howſoever, if the throng of the people had not removed me from him, I would have ſaluted him with the Nickname that was given him in the College, and brought thoſe ralleries unto his mind with which he was ordinarily upraided concerning his Father, who was one of the baſeſt Uſurers &amp;. Extortioners in the world. Some dayes afterwards I had again the curioſity to return to that abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable place, and walking along the Gallery of the Mercers, I did ſee again this Sot in a gown faced with Velvet, &amp; a Sattin Caſſock, he was ſpeaking to a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome young Girl that did ſell perfumes, and making as though he whiſpered in her ear, he did kiſſe her cheek, and plaid with her Breſts. I was reſolved then to underſtand what was the worth of my Companion, but ſeeing how he was imployed, I did at that time excuſe him, and paſſing forward, I reſolved to come more early the next day; And finding him not in that place, I walked from one ſide to another, and reſolved to wander up and down in the ſeverall turnings, where immediately I happened on ſome Chambers very obſcure, and ill built, where I ſaw an infinite number of Scribes, ſome whereof ſearched the Rolls, others were writing, and from time to time did tell great ſums of money, which did infinitely poſſeſſe me. I was amazed to obſerve with what ſpeed they counted it; at the laſt I beheld my young Gallant to come out of the next Chamber, in the ſame equipage in which he was the day before. He was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a diſconſolate Damoiſel who held a Paper in her hand, and by an old Man of a good Countenance in a long Robe, who did ſpeak unto him bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, and with great Reſpect, although the Damoiſel did not ſo much as turn her head aſide to look upon him, but did ſing to her ſelf ſome part of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly Ditty, which began thus,
<hi>Alas! who ſhall haſten the time where I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe he did go with great haſt, and I could not follow him, I adviſed with my ſelf to call him by that Name which the Scholars gave him, conceiving that I who had ſuch familiarity with him, might ſpeak more freely to him than thoſe who followed him. You, you, <hi>Tocaret,</hi> ſaid I, whither do you run with ſo much haſt? wherupon one of the tellers of the money taking notice to whom I ſpake, did come out of his place, and ſtriking me with his fiſt, Impudent (ſaid he) I will make you quiet enough; if I knew (Diminutive Clerk) to what Proctor you do belong, I would cauſe you to be ſoundly puniſhed: If there were not many about him, who ſeemed to be all of them againſt me, I had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly revenged my ſelf; but all that I could then doe, was to anſwer his words, and to tell him in my paſſion, that I was no Proctors Clerk, but a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman. This made that wretched fellow to laugh with an open mouth, and ſay unto thoſe who were about him, Obſerve but what a countenance of a Gentleman he bath, with his elbows out, and his Cloak that laughs at us, and all the world, in ſhewing its teeth. How! you infamous Wretch (ſaid I) Do you reckon of Nobility but only by the habit? I had ſaid more unto him, but that an honeſt young Man who carried a good quantity of Velvet under his arm, taking me by the hand did conduct me through the next Gallery, and ſaid unto me, Have a care what you ſpeak, you ought to reſpect the place where you are, and the perſons to whom you ſpeak. He is one of the Regiſters, whom you have abuſed. What is a Regiſter? (ſaid I) one who like a Griffon is alwaies ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping together with his Talons, he with his Talons ſcrapes every day Silver enough, which is laid forth upon the Table for him. He made anſwer to me, you are too ſcandalous. You have alſo, I know not by what Name, miſcalled one of the Counſellors within. What? that young Man (ſaid I) who paſſed by? I would fain have ſpoken with him; for the laſt time that I was in the College, where I received my education with him, be did ſteal from me my pens, my pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife, and my Note Book. I have certain proof of it, and I have a deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him for it. He who did ſpeak to me, and was a Sollicitor, did advertiſe me to have a care of my ſelf, in regard of the quality of the perſon. I made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer <pb n="21" facs="tcp:59287:57"/>to him, What, do you ſay he is a Counſellor? Undoubtedly he hath more folly in his head than Counſel. The Sollicitor replyed, the Court would not have conferred that dignity on him, if it did not find him capable to receive it. I made anſwer, So it is moſt commonly obſerved, that he who is advanced to the greateſt honours in the Vniverſity, is commonly the greateſt Aſſe, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry new office that he hath, doth ſerve but ſo much the more to declare his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections. Be not ſo vain, ſaid the Sollicitor. I am not vain at all, ſaid I; for by my birth I am one of the moſt noble in <hi>France,</hi> and he is but the Son of a baſe Merchant. His Place and Office doe ennoble him, ſaid the Sollicitor. And how did he come by that place? ſaid I. By his good Purſe, ſaid the Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor. I made anſwer. And even the baſeſt Abject in the world may have ſuch a quality, and cauſe himſelf to be as much reſpected, as long as he hath mony to command. O good God! ſaid I, what a ſhame is this? Where ſhall Virtue be now acknowledged? Having ſpoke thoſe words, I did forſake the Sollicitor, and did go into a great Hall full of a world of people, who trotted up and down on this ſide, and on that, like peaſe boyling in a pot. For my ſelf, if I had been carried into ſuch a place when I was aſleep, I ſhould verily believe when I wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, That I was in Hell. One cried out, others domineer'd, ſome did run, ſome with great violence did carry others to priſon. On no ſide could be ſeen the leaſt ſhadow of content.</p>
            <p>Having obſerved theſe ſad examples of the brutiſhneſſe of men, I return'd to my own Lodging, but ſo full of Indignation that I cannot expreſſe it. After Dinner, being at my Window, I deſcryed my young Coxcomb the Counſellor, paſſing through the Street, but in what Equipage think you? in the Equipage of a Signior. I was never more aſtoniſhed. He had a Cloak of three-piled Velvet of a Carnation colour, his Breeches were of Velvet of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and his Doublet of White Sattin, his thigh was armed with a Sword of <hi>Miramont,</hi> and he was mounted on a barbed Steed, and followed by three luſty Lackeys. I enquired of my Hoſt, if at
<hi>Paris</hi> Men of the long Robe were alſo Men of the Sword. He made anſwer to me, that young Gentlemen, as was that Counſellor whom I beheld, did not take upon them the formality of the Gown, but only for a quality to gain them the more reſpect, &amp; to procure them Wives with greater Dowries, and that their age leading them to the civilities of the Court, when they are once out of it, they are permitted to take the ſword and the habit of a Cavalier.</p>
            <p>Perceiving in what miſerie I was, I did wiſh I had been of the Profeſſion to which my Father did perſwade me, but I conceived it would be a diſhonor to be in the company of ſuch vile people. At that time I did feel to the quick, the pricking thorns of my mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fortune; for being cloathed with ſuch poor habit, there was not any one who did eſteem me, and in this forlorn condition, I durſt not wear a Sword; for inſtead of ſerving to be a witneſſe of my generous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, it would make me to be taken by the moſt ſotiſh people of all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Earth, for a lazie Vagabond. In the mean time, every day I ſuffer'd a thouſand Indignities, I dare not ſay patiently, for I dare aſſure you, if Power had anſwered to my Will, I had throughly puniſhed thoſe ſtupid fellows that offended me.</p>
            <p>One morning I entred into the Court of the Louvre, thinking it had been a place of Reſpect, where I ſhould receive pleaſure from the Variety of ſeverall Objects, and not be baffled, as I had been at other places. As I did regard that pompous Edifice, looking ſometimes on one ſide, and ſometimes on the other, a Page, who obſerved by my action that I was not accuſtomed to come thither, ſuppoſing me to be a ſimple Novice, did take my hat by the Brim, and gave it ſuch a twirl, that it turned eight times quite round my head; I had ſhewed him effectually who it was he had abuſed, but that behind him I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ten or twelve Lackeys, who ſeemed to be there preſent to defend him. <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59287:58"/>I told him that he did me wrong to touch me, ſince I never offended him; At that he and his Companions opened their mouths altogether, and called me Citizen, for it is a word of deriſion which that Kennell doth give to thoſe whom they eſteem to be ſimple Fellowes, in which number they comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all thoſe who do not follow the Court. It is the infamy of this age, that thoſe people who are ſo deſpicable and ſo abject that it is impoſſible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe them, ſhould abuſe a Name which hath been and is in ſo many Cities ſo paſſionately deſired. Nevertheleſſe underſtanding the malice of their miſtake, I took the boldneſſe to intreat them to look more earneſtly on him to whom they did addreſſe their words, aſſuring them they would find I am not the Man whom they did take me to be. And turning from them to be gone, they followed me with abſurd laughter, and impertinent language, and demanded of me what I was, If I was not a Citizen. I made anſwer, I am that which you will never be, and which it is impoſſible that you can deſire to be, becauſe you have neither the courage nor the apprehenſion to be as I am. To ſpeak in that manner to thoſe ignorants was to ſpeak Greek unto them, and I did repent my ſelf that I took ſuch Brutiſh things into my conſideration, at whom I ought not to be angry although they ſhould have ſpurn'd me with their feet becauſe they are Creatures deprived of Reaſon, and have not the ſence when they are chaſtiſed to underſtand, that it is becauſe they ſhould return no more unto their follies.</p>
            <p>This conſideration working in my Spirit, I retreated from them; but this curſed crew taking offence at the laſt words which I ſpake, did run after me to torment me. The Page making a ſemblance as if he would ſtrike his ſtaff upon the ground, did hit me ſo violently upon the Feet, that at every blow I leaped up as if I were cutting ſo many Capers. The Lackeys alſo being prepoſſeſſed with the ſimplicity of my deportment did aſſault me all at once, and there was one of them who affirmed that they muſt toſſe me in a Blanket. Being exceſſively provoked at that word, I ſuffered my ſelf to be tranſported to the firſt motions of choler, and retiring a little from them I did ſwear like a Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goner wet quite thorough, and covered with Durt; Come forth and you dare unto me, and giving me but a Sword, Do you fall upon me all at once, You ſhall ſee if I fear you, or not, you vile puddle; you have no valor at all, but when altogether you aſſault one Man who hath no Armes to defend himſelf. If you have not the deſire to gratifie me in letting me dy valiantly in my own defence, doe one of you kill me, for I ſhall no longer live but to my grief, and on the other ſide I have mis-fortunes enough, which do cauſe me to deſire Death.</p>
            <p>Their blind and ſtupid Rage was inflamed by theſe words, when a great lump of fleſh covered with blew Sattin and gold lace did approach unto them. I know not on my faith whether it were a man or not, but I diſcovered the form of a Body, as for his Soul it was all brutiſh. He was a Baron, (as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I underſtood) and was the Maſter of the little Page that did proſecute me; He ſaid to the three buffles who ſtood with their hats in their hands, Tell me you Waggs, Is not my Page a gallant Boy? mark but the pleaſant ſport he makes, he is a Boy of Wit and Spirit. The Page hearing the praiſe which his Maſter gave him, did determine with himſelf to make that Virtue yet more manifeſt for which he did eſteem him, and came unto me to give me a tweak on the Noſe, but I thruſt him back ſo violently that I thought I had thrown him on his back. The Baron who carryed an eye over him was angry, and twirling his Muſtachioes with one hand, and threatning me with the other, he ſaid unto me, You Sirrah look to your ſelf, if you abuſe my Page, I ſhall ſtrap you as long as I can ſtand over you. I hearing him ſpeak to me, as to thoſe wretched and ſordid Varlets, from whoſe condition I was as far removed as Heaven from Earth, did reſolve with my ſelf to ſhew him the error of his <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59287:58"/>Judgement, and addreſſing my ſelf unto his ignorant and moſt ſenſeleſſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I ſhewed unto him that I was not offended at what he ſaid, for it had no reference at all to me. There are none of quality who by your words will apprehend the little eſtimation you make of them. For my ſelf, being in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition more advanced than is theirs, and peradventure as eminent as your own, I find my ſelf no ways concerned. In this caſe the poor habit which covers me, and which hath cauſed you to entertain a bad opinion of me, might hold it ſelf injured, let that therefore decide the controverſie by its ſelf, I will have no part in it.</p>
            <p>Theſe words being pronounced (which without vanity give me leave to ſay were delivered with an extaordinary grace) they were heard by a Gentleman who walked near unto us, and perceived that ſuch Reaſons could not proceed from a vulgar Spirit, although the Baron the greateſt Aſſe in the Court had not the apprehenſion to conceive what the leaſt of my words did mean. The Gentleman therefore by little and little conjecturing that I had good paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and education, did take pitty of me, and to draw me from the fury of thoſe mercileſſe Barbarians, did adviſe me not to goe forth at that Gate, at which I entred. I followed his Counſel, condemning a thouſand times the Nobility of this age, who are followed by ſuch unworthy Creatures, whoſe petulant rudeneſſe is ſo connived at by them, that it doth excite them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit outrages againſt all manner of Perſons.</p>
            <p>But, alas, it was not by theſe people alone that I was ſo undervalued, and ſo ungently intreated, I was in the ſame manner abuſed by thoſe who make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion even of Honour and of Modeſty. In whatſoever place I was there was no Citizen would permit I ſhould have ſo eminent a regard as himſelf. In the ſtreets they would ſometimes thruſt me from the wall with their Elbows, to have me goe on the other ſide, and would call me Begger, if I teſtified my reſentment by any ſharp language to them. Nay which is more (obſerve but the extreme unhappineſſe of poverty, which is always believed to be the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of Vice) a man one time having loſt his purſe in the Crowd, it was ſuſpected that I had pick'd it, if by ſome words and actions I had not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately cauſed every one of them to entertain a better opinion of me.</p>
            <p>You will tell me that I cannot fall into thoſe inconveniences, but only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſome vain Worldlings, who paſſe their judgements according to the leaſt apparences; but underſtand, that even thoſe who had renounced the pomp and vanity of the world, did by a ſtrange unhappineſſe entertain the ſame opinion of me. A Frier, not knowing who they were, did ſuffer ten or twelve diſſolute perſons with pluſh Cloaks on their backs to enter into the Chapel, and alſo did not refuſe admiſſion to their Grooms, but as for my ſelf who would have followed them, he immediately did ſhut the door upon me. I cryed out at the Grate, My Father, let me ſpeak one word unto you; When he came nearer to me I thus proceeded, I am not come hither to admoniſh you, neither am I in a capacity ſo to do; nevertheleſſe I aſſume the boldneſſe to ſpeak unto you what I know, which is, that your Church ought to be the Image of the celeſtial houſe of our great God, and that you ought to permit the poor to take the beſt place, as it is in that happy manſion. Well, well, ſaid I and ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling did proceed, I ſee when I would come into your Chapel, the better in that place to entertain my Devotion, I muſt buy me a Cloak lined with pluſh, or take one up at the Brokers. The Frier was aſhamed, and becauſe he made haſt to leave me he heard not my laſt words, whereupon at the laſt I raiſed my voice higher, which redounded more unto his ſhame, for many who were round about me did perfectly hear, and I found by their ſmiles that they did approve my words, and mocked at him who ſo ill obſerved the rules of his Order in not cheriſhing the poor. The Frier nevertheleſſe had committed a Sin which he could not expiate but by a ſevere Repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:59287:59"/>Conſider yet a misfortune greater than the former, Thoſe who even knew of what Family I was deſcended, did not intreat me more reſpectfully. The little Youths the Children of Citizens, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I knew in the College, and had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there at my own Law, meeting me in the ſtreets, would look upon me as if they never ſaw me before; and although in a great humility I did ſalute them, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new my antient acquaintance, they would only put their hand unto their Hat, and the proud reſalutation did come with an ill will from them, ſo preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous they were to ſee themſelves covered with Silk, and to have their Grooms better cloathed than my ſelf. I did go to viſit ſome of them, who ſeemed to be the moſt courteous, and with whom I had been moſt familiar; To ſpeak the truth, they entertained me well in their Lodgings, being conſtrained to it by the Rules of Courteſie, but they would none of them take the pains to ſee me themſelves, to recompence my viſit with their own, conceiving that they ſhould debaſe themſelves too much to viſit a man ſo ill appointed as my ſelf, and that it would be a diſhonour to them, if I were ſeen in their Company.</p>
            <p>If by chance I did meet with any who diſcourſed on ſome ſubject where I had the meanes to make the fruits of my ſtudies more apparent, I therein was ſtill infortunate, for I durſt not open my mouth, knowing that the ill opinion which already was conceived of me, would cauſe all which I ſhould ſpeak to be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, and when I began any diſcourſe, I was not liſtned unto, and one or other would conſtantly interrupt me.</p>
            <p>In the mean time my habit every day did grow worſe and worſe, and I found ſo often ſuch new Rents, that I knew not which way to redreſſe them. I had laid forth all my ſtock to pay my Penſion to my Landlord, I had owed it him a long time, and the remainder was not enough to buy Stuff to piece my Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let and my Breeches, I made faſt my skirts that were unſowed with pins, and my Buttons being for the moſt part fallen off, I made uſe of ſome broken points to perform their office. The reſt I covered with my cloak in the beſt manner that I could, to the end that the other defects about me might not be perceived. At the laſt I was enforced to wear again my mourning Doublet, becauſe it was better than my grey one.</p>
            <p>I was infinitely ſenſible of the affronts which I received in that condition, and to avoid them, I was inforced to ſtay within doors all the Winter, although it were a grievous puniſhment unto me; for after ſome weeks, I had ſeen a young and a moſt beautifull Wonder at her Fathers Door in that Street that joyneth to St. <hi>James,</hi> and her attractions with ſuch advantage had triumphed over my liberty, that I did nothing elſe but ſigh after her. But what ſhould I doe to have come out of my bondage? Love is a mortal Enemy to Poverty. I durſt not ſhew my ſelf to <hi>Diana,</hi> (for that was the Name of the Queen of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> heart) I muſt be accommodated in another faſhion, for ſhe had received ſome Impreſſions in relation to me, which were not favourable. In my Solitude I had no other imployment, but to think of her, and that was the Cauſe that my paſſion did inflame it ſelf the more; I was ſuch a fool, that I took ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to paſſe every Evening by her door, although it was to me the moſt unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableſt trouble in the world.</p>
            <p>In that time I could have joyned in the ſame Trade with ſome deboiſt Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the City, by whom I found it was an eaſie thing in a ſhort time to ſupply my ſelf with new habiliments, for every night they did nothing elſe but ſteal Cloaks in a ſtreet in the Suburbs where were ſome ſcattered houſes, but I could never condeſcend to make my Spirit to ſtoop to ſuch an infamous action; I therefore entertained the Acquaintance of certain Philoſophers who promiſed me Mountains of Gold, by a way lawfull and honourable; nevertheleſſe at the laſt I abandoned their converſation, becauſe I found they were but ſellers of ſmoak, who were unwilling to communicate themſelves unto me, becauſe having nothing to loſe, their trompery would be of no uſe in my behalf. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59287:59"/>I was at leaſt as ſubtile as themſelves, and making them believe that I had a round Sum of money coming out of the Country, with which I would aſſiſt them in buying that which was neceſſary for the perfecting of their great work, I did invite them to teach me many of the Secrets of their Natural Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, which in ſeveral occaſions I have ſince made uſe of: And this was ſome profit that I received in frequenting their Company,</p>
            <p>Afterwards I addicted my ſelf to another ſtudy, which was Poetry, in our Tongue, with which I was ſo much taken, that I ſhall for ever be inchanted with it; my ordinary imployment was to make verſes on the hatred which I did bear to the iniquity of the times, and on my love to gentle
<hi>Diana;</hi> But. Good God, what works were they in compariſon of thoſe which I am now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to perform! All I did was after the mode of the College, and there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in it neither neatneſſe nor judgement; I might ſafely ſwear that at that time I had never read a good piece in verſe, and the Authors from whom I might learn any thing were unknown unto me, as well by my own negligence, as my Regents, ſo that all which I could doe, was to admire what was ſung by the old Poets of <hi>Greece,</hi> in whoſe works we do find ſo many remarkable faults, becauſe that all proceeded from their invention, and they had nothing to lay before them as a Pattern, and one thing at the ſame time cannot be invented and made perfect.</p>
            <p>Take notice in no place better than in this, that the Muſes are pleaſed to dwell with Poverty, you ſhall ſeldom ſee a rich man to delight in making ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, And the great poſſeſſions of the Goods of Fortune, are the cauſe that men delude themſelves, and neglect to poſſeſſe the endouments of the mind; Nevertheleſſe, for Poeſie there is nothing more pleaſing to the Spirit, or more uſefull for Men, in putting a great diſtinction betwixt our ſelves, and Beaſts.</p>
            <p>It was in that time, alas, that I beheld my ſelf fruſtrated of all Hopes which I had a long time nouriſhed in my Soul. I traced my adventures over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to ſee if I could there meet with any that might parallel with thoſe great perſonages whoſe Hiſtory I had read, and I imagined that undoubtedly I ſhould find an iſſue equal unto theirs, truſting in my courage and the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I had to follow whatſoever was virtuous: Oh how blind I was as not to fee the infinite obſtacles which did oppoſe my good fortune, although I had a valour more admirable than any of the antient Knights. If I had not laid down on Paper the tranſportations of my choler, I had inevitably fallen into the moſt violent Deſpair of the world. Was it not wonderfull, and did it not cure me againſt the rules of Nature? After I had deſcribed my evill, I did find it no more ſo violent upon me, although I perceived the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of moſt lively repreſented. Will any Man of Reaſon now deny that <hi>Apollo</hi> was eſteemed the God of Phyſick, as well for the remedy which his verſes do give unto the deſperate wounds of the Soul, as for what his herbs do give to the diſeaſes of the Body, which he cauſeth to grow when he taketh upon him the quality of the Sun to make the earth fruitfull?</p>
            <p>So much had <hi>Francion</hi> ſpoke, when his courteous Hoſt locking his hand in his, did ſay unto him, It is enough for this time, I perceive it groweth late, I am afraid you afflict your ſelf with too much ſpeaking, and with thoſe words be cauſed him to ceaſe; but before he would take his leave of him he did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him yet a little longer, and ſaid unto him, that truly he had been inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to himſelf, by indeavouring to hinder himſelf from the further know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Pedantick adventurrs; but Sir, ſaid he, I believe you endured tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough for the loſſe of your Silver, if I remember it aright you told me that his name was
<hi>Raymond</hi> who took it from you, would you make him ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for it, if you could find him out? I profeſſe unto you (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) that as often as I remember the miſeries which he made me to endure, my rage doth kindle as red againſt him as ever, for his fact was extremely odious, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59287:60"/>the more, becauſe he was deſcended of an honourable Family, and of the richeſt in <hi>France.</hi> The Signior of the Caſtle having a Cuſtom with him not uſual, of which few can find out the Cauſe, did ſay unto him, That it was poſſible that this <hi>Raymond</hi> had taken his money in a wanton humor, and not for neceſſity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to conceal himſelf from his Parents, and to lead a deboyſt life in
<hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and therefore if <hi>Francion</hi> would look after him, he would endeavour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him if he were in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> or not, that ſo he might call him to a ſtrict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt for it; but <hi>Francion</hi> made anſwer, That it would be the moſt ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing in the world, if he ſhould witneſſe that he carried about him the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of ſuch antient offences; his Hoſt nevertheleſſe promiſed him that he would inquire, If in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> or thereabouts, there were any Gentleman, who is, or hath been known by the Name of <hi>Raymond,</hi> that he might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand at leaſt what was become of him who robbed him. Speaking thoſe words, he did bid him Good Night, and did intreat him to diſpoſe himſelf to give him on the next Morning an Account of the reſidue of his life. After that he did betake himſelf to his Reſt, having received great ſatisfaction to hear ſuch a variety of ſubjects where Inſtructions were contained for ſeveral ſorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for though that all the world is not a Pedant, yet the Actions of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant <hi>Hortenſius</hi> are not particular to himſelf. <hi>Francion</hi> alſo did lively repreſent the ſottiſhneſſe of thoſe People, who do eſteem of none but of thoſe only who are richly habited, and eſpecially the Impertinence of the Courtiers, who gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally do diſeſteem of Citizens, although oftentimes they are better Men than themſelves. We may ſee alſo the errors of Youth ill trained up, and removed from the obſervation of their Parents: And whereſoever we caſt our eyes, we may obſerve the generoſity of the ſpirit of <hi>Francion,</hi> which never did abandon him. He whom he entertained with his brave adventures, had in his bed the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to think of it, and did receive from thence an abſolute Contentment. And we may take no leſſe our ſelves, if we will be induſtrious to make uſe of it: In purſute whereof, in the next Book we ſhall obſerve the Vanity of Poets, and of the Authors of the preſent Time, lively repreſented. The Extravagances which Love cauſeth in Youth, ſhall alſo have their place in it, and in all that, as in the Acts of a good Comedy, we may ſee how Pleaſure and Inſtruction goe hand in hand together.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the Sun had reſtored again the Day, The Signior of the Caſtle being already attired, failed not to ſee if <hi>Francion</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken good reſt that night, to the end he might know if he were able to finiſh the rehearſal of his ſeveral Fortunes. Being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lng to improve their time, their ſalutations were the ſhorter. <hi>Francion,</hi> although he found the pain of his head to be much aſſwaged, yet he determined to keep his Bed for that day, the better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect his ſtrength, and, having no deſire to riſe, he continued the courſe of his Hiſtory as I ſhall repreſent unto you.</p>
            <p>Sir, We left off yeſterday at the pleaſure which I did take in Poetrie, It is requiſite, that returning to that Subject, I ſhould inform you, that they did put into my hands certain works which were terſe &amp; elaborate enough, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which I faſhioned thoſe Poems which afterwards I compoſed; I was told of a Book newly come forth, the Author whereof was very famous, which I determined with my ſelf to buy, to learn by that how I ought to write according to the Times, for ingenuouſly I do confeſſe, I did not underſtand what I had to do. Having learn'd that the Stationer who ſold that Book did live in Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his Street, I repaired thither, and my curioſity being declared, he took the pains to ſhew me an infinite number of French Books, the names of which I had never heard of before; I had not money enough to purchaſe ſo much Merchandize, wherefore I bargain'd only for that Book which at firſt I had a deſire to buy, having borrowed money for that purpoſe. Nevertheleſſe I did not forbear to turn over all thoſe books which were upon the Counter; when behold there name into the Shop a very young Man with a pale and lean Countenance, ſtaring with his eyes in a very ſtrange poſture, he was apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in ſuch a wretched habit that I had no fear at all that he ſhould laugh at mine, ſo that before him I did ſpeak very freely to the Stationer, without ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring who did hear me. Tell me (ſaid I) if there be any one in this age who hath the reputation of a good Poet, I have always believed that there are none who excell therein, becauſe they do addict themſelves but to the cadence of the words, and unto meer riming only. In what an error are you? (ſaid the Bookſeller unto me) Have I not ſhewed you ſome admirable pieces compoſed by Authors now living? but it may be that you do not eſteem the new manner of theſe Writers, and do like of nothing but what is antient, and ſolid; I know not (ſaid I) if they write better now than heretofore, and cannot diſcern when <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59287:61"/>I make Verſes, whether they be of the new faſhion or of the old. The young Man turning his head unto me, and ſhewing the greateſt part of his teeth in an undecent laughter, I underſtand then (Sir) ſaid he, that you make Verſes. I made anſwer, I add words unto words on the ſubjects which preſent themſelves unto my Fant'sy, but they are ſo ill ordered, that I know not whether I may call the Work a piece of Poetry, or no. He replyed, That I did ſpeak that out of the humility of my modeſty, and intreated me to ſhew him ſome of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures. I made anſwer, That I durſt not give him a ſight of any of thoſe pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which peradventure were not according to the Rules which I ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and of which I had not the leaſt knowledge. Well, Sir, ſaid he, I will tell you as a Friend what I think of them, and poſſibly you may be glad that you have had conference with me; for there are not above three in <hi>Paris</hi> who can boaſt they have more judgement in Verſe than my ſelf. Thoſe words could not perſwade me to comply with his deſires; whereupon he departed, having taken two or three Books with him under his Cloak, and gave no money to the Stationer for them: I asked him how he could thrive, if be parted with his books in that manner? I do lend him them (ſaid he) and am conſtrained ſo to doe to a number of ſuch Writers as himſelf, who meet every day in my ſhop to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate and compare their Poems with one another, and here they have ſuch great aſſemblies, that there is not in all <hi>France</hi> again any place, which more juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerves to bear the name of <hi>Parnaſſus.</hi> What profit (ſaid I) do you receive by their Conferences? The Merchant laughing, did reply, The loſſe of my Books which they borrow, and never return again. I made anſwer, If I were as you, I would drive away ſuch Cuſtomers. I care not much, (ſaid he) for there is alwayes one or other amongſt them that is giving me ſome Copy to print, by which means my ſhop is made famous.</p>
            <p>After this Diſcourſe, I informed my ſelf of all the Poets of the Time, whoſe Names I learned, and found moreover that he who made the Work which I came to buy, was in good earneſt the moſt renowned of them all. The Stationer then being willing to oblige me, did promiſe me, that if I would give him one of my Poems, he would ſhew it to them, (without naming the Author) to know what faults they could find in them. The deſire I had to do well, to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the whole world, did cauſe me to accept his Profer, and on the next Morning I brought him that piece, which of all that ever I did write, did pleaſe me beſt. It was ſhewed to the whole Aſſembly of Poets, who found as many faults in it as there were words. The Stationer did me the pleaſure to give me an account of them; I ſeriouſly conſidered of it, and finding they had good reaſon for what they had done, I reſolved with my ſelf to fall no more into ſuch groſſe miſtakes.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak the truth, their Rules did tend only to make Poetry more ſweet, more flowing, and more fill'd with judgement. Who is he that would refuſe to ſee her in this Perfection? It will be objected, That great is the travell and the difficulty to compoſe Verſes after their Lawes, but if they ſhould not be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, every one would be tampering in that Art, which thereby would ſuffer in its excellence.</p>
            <p>Some time afterwards I had a perfect knowledge of theſe things, for I was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the ſhop of this Book-ſeller, where I came acquainted with all the Poets. After that my Cloak had rubb'd on theirs, I knew immediatly after that maner I ought to compoſe my Verſes. They never reproved me for above two or three faults, and in correcting them, I abſtained from thoſe which were more groſſe. I would not too much oblige my ſelf unto them, although the little which they ſaid unto me was not enough to inform the judgement of a Learner. I muſt here acquaint you what a Generation of people they are; There were ſome of them who had been Pedants in the College; Others came I know not from whence, being cloathed like Uſhers; and not long afterwards they <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59287:61"/>found the means to be habited like Gentlemen, but immediatly they returned to their firſt ragged condition, whether their Garments were borrowed, or whether they had ſold them to provide for their daily bread; Some of them did never riſe higher, nor fall lower, but did keep at a ſtay, and made no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſhow on one day than on another; Others lived on what was given them for their Copies, and others did expend the little wealth they had, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to meet with ſome Signior who might take him into his ſervice, or procure him a Penſion from the King. There was not one of them who was the Maſter of a great and of a clear Fant'sy; Their Inventions were all but Imitations, or were ſo weak that they needed a Supporter. They had nothing in them beſides the ſmoothneſſe of Language, neither was any one of them abſolute in that, for if the moſt experienced amongſt them did eſchew one error, he did chop into an other. Many of them did nothing elſe but tranſlate Books, and when they compoſed any thing of themſelves, they would commit ridiculous abſurdities. It is remarkable, that moſt of them became Poets by infection, having altogether haunted the Companies of thoſe men who did exerciſe themſelves in that facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for there is no Diſeaſe that is more catching, than is that of Poetry. I could not but lament theſe miſerable Creatures, they did write upon the imagination and confidence of their own abilities, and delightfully did deceive themſelves; Nevertheleſſe there are many Books of their writing which at this day are moſt highly eſteemed, but I will tell you, It is for want of better. We muſt look on that which is preſented to our eys, and for my ſelf, I have ſomtimes been infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to read them, finding nothing elſe to divert me. There are two or three Romances which are counted good pieces, and are highly eſteemed, but let me loſe my life, if I cannot ſhow in every one of them faults worthy of the Laſh.</p>
            <p>It is true, that although I uſed all my indeavours to be claborate, yet ſome of theſe common Scriblers were oftentimes more eſteemed than my ſelf; but theſe Men, to cry up their Reputation, did make uſe of ſome ſubtilties to which I ſcorned to debaſe my ſelf. As they are a long time in performing what they are about, ſo they have the leiſure to ſpread abroad the Report thereof, and to cauſe their Works to be deſired, by the praiſes which are given to them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ſight of them, and afterwards bringing them forth into the light, they render themſelves agreeable to ſome great Perſonage, who
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ries them up at the Court. Moreover, they have for the moſt part ſome Poetaſter at their Devotion, to maintain that they have the Empire over all the wits in the world, &amp; that they are confident they are not deceived in it, for there ar ſome at Court who ſeem to make it their buſineſſe to imploy all the Authors of the Time. Their Names are read in every Book, and without them their Works would never be printed, for otherwiſe they would bankrupt the Stationer who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to print them; ſo that by this they doe like the Wren, who to mount unto the clouds doth hide himſelf under the wings of the Eagle. Nay, which is more, our Authors are ſo vain, that they themſelves do make Prefaces, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Commendation, in which ſo exceſſively they do praiſe themſelves, that, beyond thoſe praiſe, we know not what to give unto a Deity, and this they cauſe to be printed under the Names of ſome of their Friends, who although he be eloquent enough, can never ſufficiently declare his merits. If they deſire any to make Commendatory verſes on their Works, they may well anſwer them, What need is there that I ſhould take the pains to praiſe you, you praiſe your ſelf a hundred times better than I know how to do? There is no greater Preſumption in the world, than what is practiſed amongſt theſe people, and I my ſelf have been informed, that one amongſt them aſpiring to be the Tyrant, and deſiring that all the reſt ſhould pay Homage to him, did ſay, There are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad ſome poor rebellious Spirits who are not yet come in to doe their Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, but thoſe are but petty Country Palatines who will not acknowledge <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59287:62"/>their Emperour, I ſhall make them to ſubmit whether they will or no; When this was related to me, I was in the full aſſembly of theſe miſerable Scriblers, where I had a mock for every one of them, and moreover ſaid unto them. He amongſt you may eſteem himſelf to be the King of Wits who hath an ambition thereunto, but let him know that it is I who am the great <hi>Cham,</hi> the <hi>Preſter Iohn,</hi> the <hi>Sultan,</hi> the
<hi>Sophy,</hi> and the <hi>great Mogull</hi> of all the wits not only of
<hi>Europe,</hi> but of all the world to boot.</p>
            <p>This pleaſant vaunt did make them all to laugh, nevertheleſſe they, had ſo baſe a Spirit, that they ceaſed not to reſpect him who ſtill would domineer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them and all the world. We were then in the Stationers Shop in Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his Street, where they began to make a great myſtery to write a poor Letter, for I muſt tell you, that being not able to exerciſe their wits on any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Subject, they contrived to make Epiſtles, propounding to themſelves to become glorious by that means, and they ſo much ſuſpected their own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or elſe did need the invention of others, that they cauſed the moſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular things to be printed which paſſed between their friends and themſelves, inſomuch that I did ſpeak unto them in an upbraiding mirth, that I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe one of them to travell into <hi>Italy,</hi> another into
<hi>Germany,</hi> and the third into <hi>Turky,</hi> that they might find matter enough to tranſcribe great volumes of Letters for the Preſſe; And as I obſerved in one of their Books, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and the end of every Epiſtle was full of long repetitions, I ſaid unto the Bookſeller, to render things more true, and not to omit any thing, the Author ſhould have put down the directions to every particular ſtreet, and the names of the ſtreets, and the ſignes of every houſe, and whatſoever was to be paid for the carriage of the Letters, becauſe he had made a collection of ſeveral ſmall ſums, and having thus put them all into one, he might have payed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf both for the price of his Book, and for the portage of the Letters altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This invention ſeemed very gainfull unto him, and I profeſſe unto you, that he was not unwilling to put it in practice. But to return to my Story you muſt underſtand that as his Shop was the place where all the Letters were read of theſe new Epiſtlers, who believed they had pick'd open the lock of the treaſury of well ſpeaking; all thoſe who were preſent were tranſported to ſee this new Packet of which I have ſpoken.</p>
            <p>In the end, after divers conventions of theſe Scriblers, thoſe Letters, nay rather thoſe wonders were read, which were the moſt extravagant and the moſt impertinent ones that were ever heard. He who did read them did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the words after the tone of a Comedy, and he ſeemed to act as he did ſpeak. The Auditors ſtood round about him, who one after another did ſtretch forth their necks like ſo many Cranes, and at every clauſe with an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, and an inward tranſportation, they rouled their eyes in their heads like a Bell-weather when he is angerd. The moſt apparent of them at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry period in a tone of admiration did cry out <hi>Acute and Excellent,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly the next unto him did repear the ſame words and ſo they did all one after another until they came to my turn, who as well for mockery as for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence was conſtrained to do the like, ſo that nothing almoſt was to be heard but the repetition of theſe words <hi>Acute and Excellent.</hi> I conceived to my ſelf that I was at the Eccho of
<hi>Charenton,</hi> which repeateth ſeven times that which is ſpoken.</p>
            <p>After that there was a Poet who recited his verſes, and I took much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to behold his countenance, for at the end of every Stanza he conſtantly turned his eyes to his audience to obſerve by their countenance what was their Judgement on his verſes; And obſerve this (which peradventure is more than ever you marked before) All Poets do the ſame when they read to any their own works. After this, they had great diſputations amongſt themſelves for very trivial things, omitting allogether thoſe which were of importance. Their <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59287:62"/>contentions were, if we ought to ſpeak, <hi>It were better;</hi> or, <hi>It had been better,</hi> or which was beſt to ſay, <hi>knowing Men,</hi> or, <hi>Men of knowledge;</hi> Or if, in verſe, <hi>hand</hi> ought to rime in cloſe with <hi>mend,</hi> or <hi>Realm</hi> with <hi>ſeam;</hi> And thoſe in the mean time who maintained that they were but ſo many faults, did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>more groſſe ones themſelves, for they made
<hi>periſhable</hi> to rime with <hi>fable,</hi> and <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ew</hi> with <hi>virtue.</hi> All their opinions were taken from the Tenents of ſome old Dotard, whom they followed altogether, and eſpecially they pleaſed themſelves in diſcourſing of ſome barbarous forms of ſpeech which were very common with them. Afterwards they came to ſpeak of ſome antient words, which to them ſeemed to be very good, and to be of great uſe in our language, but they durſt not make uſe of them themſelves, becauſe that he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them who was their
<hi>Coriphaeus</hi> had expreſly forbid them. Sometimes they would diſcourſe of things very commendable, which they would refer to their
<hi>Maſter Ignoramus,</hi> whoſe approbation they did take to be their Warrant, both in this &amp; on any other fant'sy which was to be authorized. At the laſt there was one amongſt them more hardy than the reſt, who affirmed that we ought to take a particular account of all the old words which were made new, and of the new ones which were invented, and make uſe of them accordingly as they ſhould be found expedient, &amp; that alſo we ſhould cut off from the Orthography all the Letters that were ſuperfluous, and in certain places out in others more convenient, of which there may uſe be made in the pronunciation, for he ſaid, It is certain that Men did ſpeak before they did write, and by conſequence did form their writing according to their words, and invented Letters which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned together had the ſound of words, I am therefore of opinion that we ought to do ſo, and not to inſert any Letters that are unprofitable, For to what end do we do it? You will tell me it is becauſe that moſt of our words are derived from the Latin, I ſhall anſwer, that it is one of the reaſons that may induce us not to follow it. We ought to ſhew the richneſſe and native beauty of our own language, and that it hath nothing of a ſtranger in it. If one ſhould make you a pair of Gloves with ſix Fingers, you could not wear them without trouble, and beſides it would ſeem ridiculous to you, and to all that do behold them; for Nature muſt either make you a new Finger to your Hand, Or the Glover muſt take away his ſupernumerary Finger. Obſerve therefore, that if in our pronunciations we do that which is moſt natural, becauſe it is not ſo eaſie to pronounce the words according to the Letters, and the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters themſelves are unprofitable, it is therefore found expedient to cut them off. In any other Tongue you ſhall not find that ſame exuberance of Letters, but if there were, evill examples are not ſo much to be followed, as is Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Conſider that the Latin Tongue it ſelf (from whence to ſpeak the truth the greateſt part of ours is derived) hath not one Letter but what is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>By the Death of Deſtiny (ſaid I) this is a good Speech indeed, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the eaſe and advantage of the publick; I allow your reaſons and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them, but where are the Inſtructions that ſhall direct us to follow them, farr to cut off ill cuſtomes which are ſuperfluous in our manners, and not dream at all to cut off Letters which are poor and innocent, and do no man any hurt. As for the new words which you ſpeak of, we ſhall no ſooner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce them, but the People and ſuch as they are obſerving their novelty, and that they are extraordinary, will laugh at us for them: But for the old words, I give my voice, that you ſhall be made choice of on the part of the French Authors, and that a new Chamber be erected, to repreſent to others the uſefulneſſe of your opinions, and to perſwade the King that he ought to cauſe it to be put in practice by all his Subjects.</p>
            <p>After I had ſpoken theſe words, and adminiſtred to every one a Subject of <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59287:63"/>Laughter, one who was the moſt gallant Man of them all, did conclude, that all which had been ſpoken did not any thing conduce to the preſervation of our Bodies, and taking us from our Books, he did bring us to the glaſſes and pots in one of the beſt Taverns of
<hi>Paris,</hi> where he entertained us to the laſt penny of all his ſtock. To ſpeak the truth, there is not a generation of Men ieſſe covetous than Poets, ſo great a deſire they have to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, where it is as difficult for a Rich Man to enter, as it is for a Cable to paſſe through the eye of a Needle; They therefore ſwallow their wealth all at once, like a pill, to make haſt thither with the greater eaſe. You ought not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how deep we did drink, nor what were the Jeſts that did paſſe amongſt us. But becauſe I did ſwear once or twice. By the Death of Deſtiny, as I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in St. <hi>Iames</hi> his Street, they demanded of me, wherefore I was ſo bold; for they ſaid, I did but mock them with it, who could not compoſe one Stanza wherein they made not mention of Fate or Deſtiny, the better to accommodate their Verſe. By the Head of Fate, (ſaid I) you are great Ignorants, and do not underſtand your own Profeſſion. Belly of the three Siſters! Do you not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that I ſwear like a Poet. You your ſelves, who do no more believe in God than
<hi>Diagoras,</hi> or <hi>Vaninius,</hi> do yet ſwear by him at every word, as if you were ſuch Devout Chriſtians that you would alwayes have his Name in your mouths. Obſerve that I did ſpeak this unto them, becauſe the greateſt part of them were Libertines; but their free and gallant humor (and which in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular is no doubt to be commended) did not take the leaſt offence at my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches. Certainly they have in them many better things than are to be found in the Vulgar, and more eſpecially in this, that they did not the leſſe eſteem me to ſee me ſo ill accommodated. But to ballance this, they had Vices again as inſupportable. They were the moſt fantaſtical and inconſtant people in the world. Nothing is more frail than their Friendſhip; for leſſe than nothing they will melt away, like the Ice of one night. Nothing again is ſo uncertain as their judgement, it changed at every turn of Diſcourſe, and on Occaſions moſt unreaſonable. Their Communication would be often ſo extravagant, as if they had been hardly indued with natural ſenſe. When I recited my Verſes to them, they would tell me to my face they were the beſt in the world, but I being gone, they would ſpeak ill of them to the firſt Man they met with, and in the ſame manner they would ſerve one another, ſo that by their own means the Reputation of every one of them miſcarried. Moreover, they did all addict themſelves to write with too much affectation, and fant'ſied nothing more. Walking in the ſtreets, they alwayes muttered to themſelves between their teeth, and had ſome Song or other by the end. All their Entertainments were only on that Subject. Being to deſcribe the Heroick Actions of ſome great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, they would not inflame their own Spirits with the leaſt Generoſity, and not ſo much as one Action that was commendable would dignify their own perſons. Beſides, they were the moſt preſumptuous people in the world, as I already have affirmed. Every one of them did believe he did better than all the reſt, and would be moſt impatient if they did not follow his opinion. I perceived by that, how much reaſon the Vulgar had to miſprize them, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes I ſaid within my ſelf, that they made profeſſion of a great Art, of which they were unworthy, and on which they did pull the hatred of the people by their ill practiſing it. They became afterwards ſo odious to me, that I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to avoyd them with as much diligence as a Pilot doth the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands</p>
            <p>I had only the deſire to preſerve the acquaintance of one named <hi>Muſidorus,</hi> who was he who firſt of all did meet me in the Book-ſellers ſhop, becauſe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived I might truly ſay that he was of a good diſpoſition, and me-thought he had ſomething in his Extravagance which rendered his Company agreeable to mine, who nevertheleſſe would not frequent it, but to raiſe delight by it.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59287:63"/>Having met him in the ſtreet, he acquainted me where his lodging was, and I promiſed to give him a Viſit. He would never tell me before where he lay, and without all doubt the Cauſe was, becauſe he lay in a Garret, and had no Bed but the cold Floor, nor Pillow but a Stone, for which he was beholding to a Maſon. His Equipage was ſo miſerable, and ſo extreamly poor, that I took compaſſion on him. It was an Axiom not to be diſputed, that when he did wear a Sword, he did on that day wear no Garters, for his Garters were his Scarf, in which he carried his Sword. There was but one Moneth in the year in which he lived not in extreme poverty, and then it was, when to gain him ſome ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance he ſold fiſh-books, if he had mony to buy them. I remember in that time that one of his Acquaintance who would be ſure to have him to run himſelf out of breath, did bring unto him the Practice of the Chanters at the Newbridge, &amp; with all told him, That if he would make Songs for them, he ſhould be ſure to be well payed, and no M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Muſidorus</hi> ſeeing the profit to be ſure enough, did not refuſe the profer, but received a piece of ſix Souſe in Earneſt of one of the Wives of the Muſicians, and ſate up all that Night to make his Verſes, and in the Morning very early did give them to her. Immediatly a Tune was ſet unto them, and they were ſung at the Bridge Foot, but no body would buy them. Thoſe who ſold Hooks did underſtand nothing of them, they were not according to their ſtile, inſomuch that the Woman did bring them back again, and demanded her mony: But he refuſing to deliver it, you may imagine with how many, and with how loud Injuries he was aſſaulted. She told him, ſhe would be even with him, and that he ſhould hear further from her, and did rail againſt him, calling him all to naught, alleging that none would buy his Songs, they were full of Conjuration and of the Names of Devils, And ſhe had reaſon ſo to do, for neither ſhe, nor the Courtiers of the <hi>Brazen Horſe</hi> could underſtand his Madrigals, nor what he meant by
<hi>Bacchus</hi> the thigh-born Infant, or by the three Fatal Spinſters. Nevertheleſſe <hi>Muſidorus</hi> did go on muttering to himſelf.</p>

            <p>The reſt of his Verſe was incomparable, and I would fain call it to mind, to give you a greater contentment. Nevertheleſſe I muſt inlarge my Account upon his Poverty. It was reported, that he was conſtrained to ſeek out ſome old pieces of rotten Timber to warm him, and having bought an old logge, he was in the way homewards overtaken by two Men of his own acquaintance, to whom he ſaid, That he had met with ſome diſſolute perſons who would have beaten him, and was therefore inforced to buy that piece of Wood to make his party good againſt them; And having covered it with his Cloak, be paſſed through the Street, and incountring with three Lackeys that aſſaulted him, he ſaid, I believe theſe unhappy boyes have a deſire to break my Lute; whereupon it was told me, that they did beat him in good earneſt, and that his cloak falling off his ſhoulders, they diſcovered the burden which he carried, and made uſe of it to beat him the more ſoundly with it.</p>
            <p>When I met him (calling to mind his former poverty, and the manifold affronts, which by reaſon of his poverty he had received) I was amazed to ſee him, for he was become quite another man than heretofore hee had been. I could not imagine what ſecret hee had uſed to change the Phyſiogmony of his Fortune. Hee was moſt <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59287:64"/>brave in his apparel, and I began much to envy his good Fortune: I believed that he had found out the Philoſophers Stone, and that by his means I might become rich, if I would but court him with my ſervice, inſomuch that one morning I aroſe before the Sun, only to wait upon him, and not to fail to give him a ſalutation before he was gone forth. I found him in bed, for you are to underſtand that the greateſt part of theſe Gentlemen do ſeldom riſe until it be eleven of the Clock, and that moſt of their verſes are compoſed when they are in bed. When I was in his Chamber, and demanded pardon for my early viſit, he teſtified unto me, that I did him much honour, and opened all the Caſements to let in the day light, whereby he might receive the better advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to dreſſe himſelf. I obſerved then, that inſtead of a Night Cap he had win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Linings of his Breeches about his head, and that all the moveables of his Chamber were reduced to a little ſtool of three Feet, and to a Coffer of Wood which ſerved for a Table, Cupbord, and Stool: The Teek of his Bed was of Stuff, but ſo old and uſed, that it was impoſſible to diſcern of what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour it had been, and was gnawed by more Rats and Mice than were in that great fight deſcribed by
<hi>Homer.</hi> All this cauſed me to judge that the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of
<hi>Muſidorus</hi> were not ſo great as I conceived, and that the little which he had he had put upon his back to make the fairer outſide.</p>
            <p>As I was on that thought he took me off from my meditation, by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant cry which he made in calling out unto his Servant, Ho
<hi>Calcaret,</hi> I am about to riſe, Bring me my Silk ſtockings of the Correction and amplification of the Inamout'd Nymph, Give me my Breeches of great <hi>Olympus,</hi> and my Doublet of the Marygold, I doubt not but my Cloak of the Lawrels of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph will come after them in good time. Theſe appellations did ſo amaze me that I could not find out the explication, For neither the Nymphs, nor the Heaven, nor the plants, were either Doublet or Breeches, nor yet Stuff to make them. My only conceit was that he had ſome Faſhion, or Colour, or Stuff, which were new and unknown, and ſo called by him; Afterwards having called for his Garters of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and his Roſes of <hi>Parthenice,</hi> I was ſo curious that I demanded of him the ſignification of thoſe words, when he, making a faint ſmile which did not paſſe ſo far as his Muſtachioes, did reply unto me, Why Sir, Do not you underſtand what I ſpeake? Know then, that my honeſt labour doth oftentimes procure me ſome ſmall ſum of Silver, which I do imploy to cloath my ſelf, and the better to know and enjoy my habiliments, I do call them by the names of the Books which I have written, and ſometimes of the Silver which I have payed for them. If you pleaſe to take the pains to travel to the Palace, you ſhall hear thoſe Books cryed which I have named, and for which, not long ſince, I have been payed. They are at this preſent the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the moſt beautifull part of the world, and there is no wayting Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman ſo low ro ſo high in underſtanding, who deſireth not to read them to learn to complement by them. But what? Do you not think well that the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers ſhould give us ſome recompence for our labour; Are not we ſo well bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed as the Advocats who will be payed for what they write? Underſtand, that if ever there was any reſtraint of ſhame in that conſideration, it is now all taken away, ſince a Marquis hath diſcovered the way unto us, and although the money was given to the Grooms of his Chamber, as a recompence of the Courteſie, yet it turned to the profit of the Maſter; it did exempt him from paying for that time any more wages to his Servants. As for that Author which you know, who imagineth that he ſleepeth in the Arms of Eloquence, and that his works are Children who will provide for their own marriage. Do you believe although he is a rich man that he gave away his Book for nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No, no, he ſold it at a good rate, and I could name unto you many others who have done the like: For my ſelf I am of that number, and do believe that I ſhall merit praiſe by it, for if my Books were worth nothing there is not any one would buy them.</p>
            <p>I could anſwer nothing to thoſe words, and began ſeriouſly to conſider with <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59287:64"/>my ſelf the miſery of that poor Scholar, who only made Books to procure him a lively hood. I then began to ſweat that we ought not to wonder at all, that Books for the moſt part were worth ſo little, for making them as big as they can, according to the ſum of money they deſire to have, they chop in many things which are unworthy to be printed, and moreover they do write with ſo much haſt that they commit an infinite number of faults for want of conſideration.</p>
            <p>His little Lackey having at the laſt brought him his Cloathes, he did riſe, when behold at the ſame time a Poet one of his Friends did enter into the Chamber, to whom he ſaid that he would ſhew him a Copy of verſes which he had made the day before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On thoſe words he pulled out of his Pocket a Paper which was as greaſie as the Leaves of an old Maſſe Book, but reading the firſt Stanza he ſaid unto us, Gentlemen, I beſeech you excuſe me, for I muſt do that which neither Kings nor Emperours can do by their Ambaſſadours. I uſe unto you no Ceremony at all, you know the honeſt liberty which is now in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion at the Court. And, on thoſe words having left us, he was about one quarter of an hour at the Privy, where, his Spirits wandring amongſt the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his poetry, he had quite forgot us. But returning at laſt he ſaid unto us, Gentlemen, Let us goe on with my verſes, and ſpeaking thoſe words he preſented us with a naſty Paper eaten round about, and in the middle of it a ſoft and a thich ſpot of yellow, which did ſo ſurprize us that we knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to laugh, or to be angry. But he having recovered his Spirits which his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination had preoccupyed, did acknowledge that it was only a waſt and a foul paper which he had brought unto us inſtead of his Verſes, and ſaid unto us, Gentlemen, Excuſe my overſights, you are both of my profeſſion, you know that the ſtrength of our imagination doth ſometimes ſo violently poſſeſſe us, that we know not what we doe our ſelves. I have brought hither another Paper than that which I did promiſe, I will go look out that in which my ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were written.</p>
            <p>Speaking thoſe words he returned from whence he came, but he found not the Paper which he looked for, by a miſtake he had wiped his Poſteriors with it. In the mean time I could not but laugh exceſſively, and his friend being diſcontented at it, did ſay unto me. What ayl you Sir? we have ſeen no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary. It is not long ſince (I remember) that
<hi>Muſidorus</hi> did commit the like merry miſtake. He came from the Privy with the defiled Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in his hand, and in the multiplicity of other thoughts, conceiving, it to be his Hand kerchief he did wipe his beard with it. He is very ſubject to ſuch tranſportations of Spirit, and oftentimes takes one thing for another: Being one day at the Table of a Grand Signior, thinking to ſpit on the ground, and to put a piece of meat that was commended to him on his Trencher, he did ſpit on his Trencher, and did let the meat fall, to the ground. As the Poet did ſpeak theſe words <hi>Muſidorus</hi> returned and not finding the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, was conſtrained to repeat his verſes by heart. After that, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of a Mask that was to be danced at the Court, on which ſubject he told us that he had undertake to write ſomething, although he was not yet payed for it. I conceived with my ſelf it was very requiſite that I ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to write ſomething on that Subject the better to be acquainted with the faſhions of the Court, and without making ſemblance of any thing, I enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red who was the Lady that was to repreſent the Queen, determining to make ſome Verſes for her.</p>
            <p>Some dayes afterwards having compoſed them, it was my Fortune to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with a Gentleman that had a part in the charge of the Mask, who much approved my Deſign. I cauſed then certain Copies which I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be printed, and the day in which the Mask was to be danced, being come, I repayred to the <hi>Louvre</hi> with my Verſes under my Arm, having at leaſt three hundred Copies of them well printed, and ſet forth in the beſt manner <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59287:65"/>that poſſibly I could, ſo that I was at a great charge in the performance; but the honour which I hoped to receive for the compoſing of ſo brave a Work, did cauſe me to make no reckoning of my coſt or labour. You are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that I was ſo glorious in my own conceit, that I ſeemed to be a perſon very neceſſary to the State, and that to ſerve the Kings, as I did in the Mask, was to ſerve him in a buſineſſe of the greateſt importance. I acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all whom I knew of it, and ſome whom I did not know, but more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Advocate of my Country, who being turned out of his place of a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant im the Election of a City, for ſome folly which he had committed, was now come to dwell in
<hi>Paris,</hi> hoping that a Proctor of the Court who was his Kinſman, would get ſome practiſe for him. He had ſo great a deſire to ſee this brave Mask, of which I had told him ſo many wonders, that he was reſolved he would venture hard, but he would find admiſſion to it. He believed that he might enter as eaſily as into the Showes at the Fair of St. <hi>Germans,</hi> which he had ſeen not long before for a Souſe. Moreover he determined to take with him his Wife and Children, with their Nurſe, becauſe that courteſy is common amongſt the Nobility towards Ladies; he alſo remembred, that when the Comedians played in the City from whence he came, he always entred for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, any, and had a place kept for him. He therefore did put on his beſt Caſſock, and his Holiday Cloak, and I know not how, he forgot his Robe of the Court, to render him more venerable, and gain him better reſpect. As for his Wife, ſhe was cloathed in her Nuptial habit, which was not much worn, for ſhe did put it on but four times in a year, and that was at ſome extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meeting, to ſhew her ſelf in all her pomp. I was much amazed when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held them, as I was waiting with many others at the little Gate which through the long Galleries doth lead to <hi>Burbon</hi> Hall, The Advocate marched in mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent array, with a Senatorical countenance. His Caſſock was of Damask, and, if I hear the truth, it had been ſometimes the Curtains of an old bed, and had been dyed from Red into Black. The pieces which were ſowed together with great Symmetry were ſo large, that there were but three from his girdle to his collar, two on one ſide, and one on the other. His Cloak was lined, at leaſt to apparence, with Pluſh unſhorn, yet the Detractors did affirm, It was only a Preface that made a little ſhew in the fore-part of it, but in the body of it there was no lining at all; but howſoever it was, I know well enough that it was the ſame Cloak which ſerved him in all ſeaſons, and that in Summer he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the Pluſh to be ripped out, but what was on the Cape, and cauſed it to be put in again when the leaves began to fall from the Trees, having learned that ſecret from Monſieur <hi>Alaric</hi> in the abridgement of his long Studies. As for Madamoiſell his Wife, ſhe had a Jump on of yellow Sattin, greaſie all over, and a Petticoat of another colour, but all before it in the ſame Condition as was the Jump, and a Collar ſo well mounted, that I know not to what better to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare her, than to St. <hi>George</hi> his Virgin in our Churches, or to thoſe Puppies which are wriggling their tails at the doors of our Chambermaids. Her Nurſe was more odly attired in a Coyf that had two flapps, like two ears, falling down on her ſhoulders, ſhe carried a child in her arms, and had another a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bigger that walked by her, and I have often laugh'd to my ſelf, when ſince I have ſee in Contemplation the ſtrange Garbs, and poſtures of this Family, and me-thinks at this preſent I have them in my eye, but eſpecially the Advocat, who in great ſtate ſtalked before them, and at every other ſtep almoſt would turn to his Wife, and ſaid unto her, Sweet-heart, Take faſt hold by my Cloak, and Nurſe, Be you ſure that you doe not loſe the ſight of us, and above all things have a care that when we are entring in the Child doth not cry.</p>
            <p>This was ſpoken with ſo gracefull an Action, that all the Courtiers who were preſent took notice of the ſimplicity of the perſon, and being willing to <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59287:65"/>make ſome ſport, they did withdraw themſelves a little, to give him leave to make his approaches to the Gate. It is true, that divers who were preſent did conceive him to be the Advocate of ſome Grand Signior; for otherwiſe he would have never had that Aſſurance as to have preſumed to have entred. He arived juſt as
<hi>Geropole,</hi> who was then Captain of the Guard, did open the Gate to let ſome of the Dancers in. The Advocate did put forwards, and approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, did ſpeak this ſtudied Speech, Sir, Having underſtood by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown of high ſounding tongues, that at this day there is a great Feaſt within, full of all maskfull Recreations, Curioſity, which ordinarily doth ſpur all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hearts, hath brought me hither, to behold theſe gallant ſports of the King and the Queens; May it pleaſe you therefore to introduce me to them with my little Family, who will alwayes inculcate it in our memories, as the benefit of your affability.</p>
            <p>You muſt imagine, that he did ſpeak theſe words with a demure counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and with the ſame accent, as if he had made an Oration before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of an Univerſity, and you may judge withall what contentment this did give to <hi>Geropole,</hi> who was one of the moſt conceited Men of all the Court. And as he was full alwayes of witty replies, ſo on this occaſion he did not forget himſelf. Imagine then, that you do ſee him without a Hat, and a Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Cap on his head, a Bunch of Keys in one hand, and every one as bigg as the Keepers key of the Common Jayl; In his other hand a handkerchief, with which he is alwayes wiping the ſweat from his face. In this Poſture he was, and having a little reſted himſelf, he took his ſtaff which was cloſe by him, and fetching breath at every word, he ſaid unto the Advocate, By my troth Sir, You will hardly believe how weary I am with beating Men away, I have done nothing elſe all this day, and I admire how you can have the Conſcience to put me to this trouble again; but I ſee I muſt recollect my ſtrength, and I ſwear unto you, if you will but ſtay one half quarter of an hour longer, I will beat you your belly full.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Geropole</hi> did ſpeak theſe words ſo pleaſantly, that all thoſe who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent did begin to laugh, and ſeeing the ſmall account he made of the Advocate, there came a throng much like unto the waves of the Sea when the Sea is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and carried the Advocate a great way off with all his Family. He in vain complained of the great diſcourteſy that was offered to him; I was hurried up and down amongſt the reſt, and took no care to approach to his aſſiſtance, being unwilling to skreen betwixt him and the abuſe, and afraid that the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers ſeeing me to be of his acquaintance, would make a mock of me; I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that he having received that affront, the Pages and the Lackeys would have recourſe unto him, and play upon him by turns, which accordingly they did, &amp; thruſting him from one ſide to another, at the laſt he fell down in the dirt, &amp; it was told me, that the Pluſh of his Cloak was as dirty as the hairs of a Water-Spaniel who had been 15 days ſeeking his Maſter. As for the Miſtreſſe and the Nurſe, they ſaved themſelves with their Children; for in thoſe dayes Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſſe and Cruelty were not ſo great at Court, as to injure Women and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children, and there was not any who had a deſire to meddle with them; for they were ſo foul, that there were none in all the Preſſe who would deal in ſuch vile merchandiſe. But howſoever it was, neither the Husband nor the Wife had ever afterwards a deſire to ſee a Mask at the Court.</p>
            <p>But how came it about that they could let this poor Lawyer alone with his Damask Caſſock, without affronting him with all manner of farther Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſeeing all thoſe whom the Pages did incounter (who were in the habit of Citizens) did ſuffer a thouſand Indignities? I knew one Gentleman my ſelf very well qualified, who being in mourning apparel, and therefore not known, was taken for a Citizen, and handled rudely enough before the Scoundrels <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59287:66"/>would let him go: For my ſelf I thruſt my ſelf forward among the reſt, and ſo prevailed that I came up cloſe to <hi>Geropole,</hi> to whom having ſhewed the verſes for the Mask, he without any difficulty gave me admittance. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner many others were admitted who were acquainted with the Dancers, ſome carrying in their hands one property for the Mask, and ſome another, and it was not troubleſome unto them to perform the office of a Groom, becauſe upon that account the Door freely was opened to them.</p>
            <p>When I was entred with this Company, my troubles ended not, I was to paſſe through ſo many Gates, and to traverſe ſo many Chambers, that I thought I never ſhould have done. I found a great difficulty in all, and that my paſſeport in my hand was very neceſſary for me. The Throng beſides was ſo great that it denyed me entrance as well as the Guard. At the laſt I came into the long Gallery of <hi>Burbon</hi> which butts forth upon the River where of neceſſity I muſt ſtay.</p>
            <p>Many Courtiers were there who deſired to know what I had in my hand, and beholding the papers made up in length as if it were Linnen, they were ſome of them ſo ignorant as to demand of me, Is the King going to Supper? Are not thoſe Napkins which you carry? I made anſwer, They are Verſes for the Mask, whereupon one of them who ſeemed to underſtand me, drew more near, and ſaid, They are Grants of Pardons, and ever as I walked up and down ſeeking ſome place to repoſe my ſelf, One or other of them thinking to ſpeak wiſely would cry out Papers, papers; There is one who carrieth Papers. Thoſe words were accompanied with a contempt, which made me underſtand, that whatſoever things theſe Beaſts did ſee, were they never ſo well done, they took them all for Libells, and that Sciences were ſuch a horror to them, that they were ſick at heart when they ſaw but a Paper, from whence they would take a Subject for their mockeries. But howſoever it was, my papers ſerved me in good ſtead, for there being nothing in the room but bare walls, I ſate upon them, and ſaw many great Signiors, who being quite weary of walking up and down, were conſtrained at laſt like ſo many Apes to ſit on their Tails.</p>
            <p>After I had been there a little time, the door was opened, at which I was to goe to <hi>Burbon</hi> hall. The throng was ſo great to enter in there, that I thought we had been all put into a Preſſe to have our quinteſſence extracted. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe we came all at laſt ſafe and ſound into the Hall where the Mask was to be danced, where I found all the places taken up, and knew not on which ſide to turn me; I endeavoured to make room for all the world, but no body for me. One did toſſe me on the one ſide, and another on the other, ſo that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved my Body was made a Baloon, I was ſo bandyed up and down amongſt them. One of the Guard who was my friend did deliver me from that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and ſetting me on the Scaffold where the Muſicians for the Mask were to play, he told me that I ſhould have a place there whether they would or no, until ſuch time as the Mask began. Being there I looked for no other ſeat but my papers that were my faithfull Companions, and no ſooner had I ſate down upon them, but the Muſicians came. They had all of them their Leſſons pricked in looſe papers, and having no desk on which to place them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that I was ſet there on purpoſe to ſervet them. One of them took a Pin from his Ruff, another from his ſleeve, and pinned their papers on my cloak, and I had ſome of them faſtned to my back, and ſome under my Arms; One of them did faſten his paper to my Hatband, but that had been nothing, were not another of them ſo impudent as to goe about to pin alſo ſome of them upon my Breſt. I told him, I could not indure the indignity, and that it would be very prejudicial to me, but he gave me good words, and repreſented to me, that in that place we muſt be helpfull to one another, I was ſo afraid that they would force me thence, or beat me, that I was brought to that point as to tell them, that they might faſten their papers where they would. One of them
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59287:66"/>therefore did put his paper to my mouth to have me hold it there, and I kept cloſe my teeth and my lips to retain what was given me, like a Spaniel that fetcheth and carryeth whatſoever is thrown him. The Muſicians round about me were tuning of their Inſtruments, when
<hi>Geropole</hi> perceiving me, did remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that I was one of the Poets of the Mask, and called me to deliver my ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as well as the others. Ah Monſieur, ſaid I, How would you have me to come unto you? Do you not ſee how I am hung round with Muſick? Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my mouth to ſpeak thoſe words the Paper fell down, which made <hi>Gero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole</hi> laugh, and continue his mirth he ſaid unto me, Come away, and make all the haſt you can, The Queen doth ſtay for you, ſhe would ſee the verſes which you have made for her. When I heard thoſe words, I was ſo earneſt to be gone, that without conſidering I had more Verſes faſtned on me, than on the Corner of a wall, I began lightly to come down the Scaffold; you might have then beheld all the Muſicians to take faſt hold of me, ſome with their hands, and ſome with the Bowes of their Viols to have their Muſick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. To repreſent unto you their ſeveral poſtures, imagine that you ſaw thoſe who in the laſt years Almanack would take the Moon, ſome of them with Ladders, which they could make either long or ſhort, as they pleaſed themſelves, others with hooks, and ſome with pincers. At the laſt thoſe Diſciples of
<hi>Bocan</hi> did recover all their papers, ſome parts of them being torn, and under the conduct of <hi>Geropole</hi> I did go to offer my verſes to the Queen. I believe that thoſe who were payed for making theirs, did look upon me with a very evill eye, but they could not fear that their penſion ſhould be taken from them to be given to me, for I was not cloathed well enough to make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there were any good parts in me.</p>
            <p>I will not undertake to deſcribe unto you the inventions of the Mask, I will only ſay, that I ſaw there the Repreſentations of thoſe wonders which I took ſo much pleaſure to read in the Romances. I ſaw Rocks move, I ſaw the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the Sun, and all the Stars to appear in one Hall, and Chariots flying in the Air; I heard Muſick as ſweet as that of the <hi>Elyſian</hi> Fields, and in effect I belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that <hi>Arganda</hi> again had brought her Inchantments to the world. That was all the benefit I received for ſitting up ſo many nights in making my verſes, for in that way I hoped neither for profit nor honour. Nevertheleſſe my Books did run in my head, and I conceived than if I ſhould dedicate a Hiſtory which I had in the Preſs to a Noble man, it would conduce to my advancement. Amongſt all thoſe of the Court I made choice of one from whom I hoped for much favour, to which purpoſe I ſought the acquaintance of the Gentleman who did govern him; I expected all aſſiſtance from him, and counted to him in brief the ſervices I was capable to do for <hi>Philemon,</hi> for ſo was the Signior called, whom I deſired to ſerve, I told him I could play on the Lute, and that I had extraordinary Songs, and moreover could tell the merryeſt Tales in the world, and ſuch as would make <hi>Heraclitus</hi> to laught. He found proofs enough of all what I ſaid, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>inderance to me in my advancement to
<hi>Philemons</hi> ſervice: He belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that if I ſhould poſſeſſe his ear, he ſhould be quickly dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſteemed himſelf. And indeed qualities ſuch as mine had a juſt cauſt to be ſuſpected by him. He was ſo far from aſſiſting me to ſpeak unto his Lord, that one morning when I waited at his Gate to preſent my Book unto him, he came to demand it of me, and told me that he would diſpoſe <hi>Philemon</hi> to the acceptance of it, and ſome Gentlemen who were with him being gone, he would call me up to him to ſalute him my ſelf; I who was without deceit, and unacquainted with the diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation of the Court, did forthwith give him my Book, and he did carry it into <hi>Philemons</hi> Chamber, where I cannot learn what he did with it, for I never ſpake with any one who at that time was with him. Not long after <hi>Philemon</hi> coming forth with a gret Retinue, he attended on him, but the laſt of all, and told me that he had not the opportunity to commend me to his Maſter on that <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59287:67"/>day, that it was enough that he had received the Preſent of my Book, which could not have been better if I had put it into his own hand my ſel;f Having ſpoke thoſe words, he turned his head another way, to ſpeak to ſome one e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe, and minded me no more. On the next Morning I addreſſed my ſelf again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, to importune him to bring me to
<hi>Philemon,</hi> but to no purpoſe at all. He ſeeing me ſtand at the Gate did come unto me, and ſaid, What do you ſtay here for, you do but get cold in your Feet? Having heard thoſe words which teſtified the ſmall deſire he had that I ſhould ſee <hi>Philemon,</hi> as ſoon as he did turn his back I did goe away without bidding him Farewell.</p>
            <p>I did not only think he was afraid it would be a diſadvantage to him if I ſhould ſerve <hi>Philemon,</hi> but withall, that he did hinder me from delivering my Book unto him, becauſe he had a bad opinion, as well of the Courteſie as of the underſtanding of his Maſter, for he gave me a ſubject to believe, that the reaſon why he did not preſent me to him, was the fear he had I ſhould know he had not the ſpirit to ſpeak three words of courſe to thank me for my love, and it was poſſible that he could not read my Book, and did no more underſtand what was in the Epiſtle, than if it were in the language of the <hi>Indians;</hi> I will not ſay, howſoever, that he was ſo ignorant, for <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Works doth truly affirm, that Detraction is one of the greateſt Vices. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from him, I bad the Devil take both the Book and the Lord <hi>Philemon</hi> alſo, and did proteſt that I would commit no more ſuch follies, to dedicate Books to ſuch ſtupid perſons, who do believe they do much oblige you, if they only but receive them, and will not ſee you, but as ſeldom as poſſibly they can, fearing you will importune them for one favour or another.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe I addreſſed my ſelf to a Gentleman of
<hi>Philemons</hi> acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to whom I complained of my misfortune, I ſatisfied him that I was not ſo mercenary as to deſire any Preſent, but only, his countenance, and that he would be pleaſed to procure me a penſion from the King; for although I was but young, I had ſome deſings ſo advantagious to the State, that they ought to be acknowledged.

            <p>But peradventure it will be objected, theſe Lines are too vain to commend to a young Virgin, and of a good Family; I believed that ſhe could not take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions at them, and becauſe the Letter aſſumed not ſo much liberty, I uſed a clean invention to have both delivered into her hands. Underſtanding that her Father was gone abroad into the fields, and that ſhe was at home alone with a Maid Servant (for her Mother was dead) I ſent a Lackey of my friends with ſome papers in his hand to demand if her Father were within or not. It being aſſured no, he preſented the papers to her, and intreated her on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to put them into his hand, ſaying they concerned his Maſter whom her Father knew very well, for her Father was his Advocate. The Papers being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, he made haſt away, and <hi>Diana</hi> ſuſpected nothing, for it is the cuſtom of Lackeys to be always running:
<hi>Diana</hi> knowing that her Father would not ſudenly return had the curioſity to open that paper which was too handſomly folded up to be a Bill of Law, and by this means that which I did hope for was accompliſhed, and ſhe (as ſince I have underſtood) finding that both the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers did addreſſe themſelves unto her ſelf, did believe that they came from the Lackeys Maſter, who oftentimes had made profeſſion of his Love unto her.</p>

The young man not knowing what anſwer to return did believe ſhe had a deſire to put a trick upon him, and denyed that he had ever ſent any Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by his Lackye to be delivered to her or any elſe: But <hi>Diana</hi> confirming that ſhe had received them, and acquainting him with the Lackye who did preſent them, he preſently collected that they came from ſome Gentleman who unknown unto her was enamoured of her, and obſerving ſhe confidently did believe that he was the Author of them, he firſt demanded of her, if the Letter and the Verſes were acceptable to her, and finding by her words that there was nothing in them which procured the leaſt ſhadow of diſcontent from <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59287:68"/>her, he ſaid unto her, that he could no longer conceal that it was indeed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf who had ſent thoſe papers to her, becauſe he did conceive it neceſſary that ſhe ſhould underſtand the great deſire he had to ſerve her; Moreover, he had underſtanding enough to aſſure her, that if ſhe had refuſed to receive that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, he had ready the invention to chide his Lackey for his miſcarriage, and to tell him that the papers were of great importance, which contained matters of Law, and needed the aſſiſtance of her Father. Howſoever, to keep all things with greater ſecrecie, he adviſed her for her part to perſiſt to ſpeak unto his Lackey as before, and to inform him, how much he was deceived in the execution of his charge, being to deliver thoſe Letters to ſome other young Gentlewoman, and not unto her ſelf. He afterwards underſtood by his Groom the Commiſſion which I had given to him; Nevertheleſſe he ſo continued to perſwade <hi>Diana</hi> that it was he who compoſed thoſe verſes, that ſhe was conſtrained to make proteſtations to him, that ſhe believed what he ſaid; and becauſe ingenious Spirits were very pleaſing to her, believing that he was the Maſter of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent underſtanding, ſhe did begin to give more reſpect unto him than to all the reſt of thoſe who courted her.</p>
            <p>After this I made many more verſes for her, and meeting one day
<hi>Diana</hi>'s Servant in the Street, I ſaid unto him, Honeſt friend, give this Song to Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle <hi>Diana,</hi> The other day I did promiſe it unto her. The Servant made no difficulty at all to take the paper and carry it to <hi>Diana,</hi> who could not but believe it came from the ſame party as before, becauſe the Gentleman who had ſpoken to her on the day before, might well have given them unto him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would truſt no more his own Groom with the carriage of ſuch pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>
            <p>But to make <hi>Diana</hi> underſtand that the verſes did intirely proceed from my ſelf, on the next Evening, as ſhe ſate at the Gate, after Supper, I paſſing by did ſing aloud one of thoſe Stanzaes which I had ſent unto her. She, who had a good Memory, did remember where ſhe had ſeen them, and immediatly did faſten her eye upon me.</p>
            <p>But that was not ſufficient, I did write another Letter to her, and did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive a way how it might arrive to her own hand. I did thruſt it therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two lids of her Coffer which was on the Bench which ſhe had at St: <hi>Severins,</hi> and the next day being <hi>Sunday,</hi> as ſhe opened her Coffer, to take from thence her Muff, and a little Book of Devotion which ſhe had put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſhe found my Letter. This Letter contained many extreme aſſurances of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and withall informed her, that if ſhe had a deſire to underſtand who it was did write it, ſhe ſhould obſerve him, who for the time to come would ſeat himſelf in the Church directly over againſt her, being cloathed in a Suite of Graſſe green, which I had made on purpoſe to be the more agreeable unto her; And becauſe ſhe had found my Letter in the morning, as ſhe was preparing to go to Maſſe, ſhe had the opportunity to read it before ſhe came to Veſpers. When ſhe was there, ſhe might eaſily diſcover that I was her Lover, for on the beginning of the Sermon I placed my ſelf cloſe to her ſeat, ſo great a care I had not to fail in my enterprize. I but ſlowly moved my eyes, and as it were by a compaſſe, as an ingenious Artiſt doth make his motions to turn, and my little murdereſſe had ſuch an aſſurance, that although ſhe had wounded my Soul, yet ſhe looked ſtedfaſtly upon me, and peradventure not with ſo much ſhamefaſtneſſe as I looked upon her: But by reaſon that her Seat was low, and that there were ſo many men directly oppoſite to it, ſhe, during all the time of the Divine ſervice, did ſit at the lower end of it, that I more fully might behold her. I knew not well, whether I might call it a cruelty or a curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, for in one Conſideration ſhe obliged me, becauſe I loved nothing more paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionatly than her ſelf; but on the other ſhe did me as great an injury, for every one of her looks did ſeem to me as an Arrow ſhot into my heart, which <pb n="16" facs="tcp:59287:69"/>when I returned home, I found to be wounded all over.</p>
            <p>Some dayes afterwards I did meet her in a ſpacious ſtreet, ſhe was on the one ſide thereof, and I on the other, and both ſides very full of Houſes. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, as if attracted by a Loadſtone, we came ſo near to one another, that when ſhe croſſed the way, our heads did almoſt touch, ſo much did they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the languiſhment of our Souls; for this lovely fair one had already ſome affection to me. Nevertheleſs I durſt not have accoſted her, if it had not been by the mediation of another, in which Fortune moſt advantagiouſly did favour me; for a Kinſman of this fair <hi>Diana,</hi> who had been my Companion in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, did at that time come to live in the ſame houſe with her. I diſcourſed with him one day, to underſtand how her affections were enclined, and repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my Verſes to him, he aſſured me that his Coſin had ſhewed them unto him, and commended the piece to be incomparable. Underſtanding the good will which this young Man did bear unto me, I determined with my ſelf to conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>l nothing from him, and having related to him the ſtory of my Love, I deſired him to make known unto <hi>Diana</hi> the true Author of thoſe Pieces which ſhe had lying by her. He failed not to doe it, and by the Impulſion of an exceſſive Love, he did aſſure me of all the courteſies which the braveſt Perſonage in the Earth could expreſſe. I did not forget to repreſent unto him that I was deſcended from one of the moſt noble Families in <hi>France.</hi> This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovered to her, the Gentleman who attributed my Works unto himſelf, was known to be but a baffler, and loſt her love, and his own reputation at once. <hi>Diana</hi> deſired nothing more than that I ſhould diſcourſe with her, but ſhe had an old Man to her Father, who would not with patience endure that ſhe ſhould be ſeen in the Company of any who was not of his own Acquaintance, finding his Daughter to be of a flexible Diſpoſition, and eaſie to be ſuborned: Our enterview therefore could not ſo ſuddenly be procured.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I ceaſed not to court her with my eyes, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly at the Church as often as ſhe was preſent. One day I repaired thither with a Gentleman of my Acquaintance, but ſhe was not yet arrived. I walked up and down all that afternoon, and being deſirous to eaſe my ſelf, I ſate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a planck which was faſtned to the forepart of her Seat, and I failed not to doe my obeyſance to her and to her Siſter with her, (who was already marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) when ever they came into their Seat; And becauſe he who was with me ſhould not diſcover my affection, I endeavoured to conceal the trouble of my Spirit, and to hold ſome diſcourſe with him.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman was a Courtier, and I did ſpeak ſomething loud unto him, and ſometimes he laughed, and ſo did I alſo, not dreaming that I troubled my Miſtreſſe or her Siſter. We did riſe up ſometimes from our Seats, yet purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Diſcourſe, when, behold they did riſe from their own places, and did take the poſſeſſion of our Seat; I who was as jealous in thoſe affairs as poſſibly any One could be, did infallibly believe that they and it on purpoſe to remove me, and inforce me to ſeek out a place to ſit farther from them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not be tormented with the extravagance of our Diſcourſe; Immediately I withdrew my ſelf, to teſtifie unto them I did ſo much Reverence them, that I was touched with much ſorrow I had diſpleaſed them: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe I will confeſſe unto you, I was moſt extremely paſſionate; for I was ſo ſenſible of the affront which in my opinion <hi>Diana</hi> had ſhewed unto me in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing me, that in the exceſſe of my Rage, I was even ready to expreſſe, that ſhe need not be ſo ſcornfull, for I was at the leaſt as good as her ſelf, it being ſome honour to her to have a place in my affection, who ought to fix my eyes on Ladies of a far greater Family than her ſelf.</p>
            <p>All the night following I did nothing but ruminate on this affront, and could take no reſt, until I had conferred with the Kinſman of
<hi>Diana<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to whom I complained of the Injury which I had received, having even tears in my eyes; <pb n="17" facs="tcp:59287:69"/>whereupon he did begin to laugh ſo heartily, that it did encreaſe my affliction, for I believed that he did mock me with it; but obſerve how he appeaſed me. My dear Friend (ſaid he) and in that appellation did embrace me, You are too blame to be ſo jealous, as to conceive that <hi>Diana</hi> both undervalue you, which is an Incivility far from her Nature: you would laugh your ſelf, if you knew the Cauſe of your Miſtake; I remember that yeſterday in the Evening when ſhe returned from Church, ſhe complained to her Servant of ſome Beggar, or ſome other naſty Fellow, who finding her Pue open, had loathſomly defiled it, and that was the Reaſon which made her to come out of it; but the
<hi>Cyprian</hi> powder with which you were covered, did happily hinder you from partaking in ſo bad a ſavor.</p>
            <p>This Account did much content me, and I had the curioſity to return to the Church, to prove whether his excuſe was true, or not: I found there the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſtill in the Pue, which was not yet made clean, and the ſight of that filthineſſe did more pleaſe me, than if I had ſeen the ſweeteſt and the faireſt flowers in the world, becauſe it delivered me from the extremity of my paſſion. When <hi>Diana</hi> underſtood my ſuſpition, you may believe that ſhe did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from laughter; nevertheleſſe it turned all to my advantage, becauſe by that ſhe might perceive the paſsion which I had to preſerve my ſelf in her good opinion.</p>
            <p>It is ordinarily ſpoken, That the price of things is valued by the difficulty in the procuring them, and that we undervalue thoſe things which are eaſie to be obtained, I never underſtood that truth better than on this occaſion; for when I found ſeveral obſtructions in gaining the familiarity of <hi>Diana,</hi> I moſt violently did love her. And now ſince her Coſin promiſed me to bring me into the Houſe, when her Father was gon abroad, and to help me not only to the Speech of her, but alſo ſo far to perſwade her, that I ſhould obtain a good place in her affection, I did perceive my paſſion to languiſh by degrees. The principal Cauſe was, that although her favors were moſt conſiderable, yet I ſhould never enjoy her, unleſſe I were married to her, and I had too high a Courage, to ſtoop ſo low as to take to Wife the Daughter of a ſimple Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. And knowing moreover, that every Man of Iudgement doth affirm, That he is moſt happy who can avoid ſuch heavy chains as thoſe of Marriage, they were altogether a horror to me. Nevertheleſſe, being unwilling it ſhould be ſaid, that I loved a Maid, and yet did never ſpeak unto her, I did give a viſit to the Kinſman of <hi>Diana,</hi> and by that means did find the opportunity to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with her. She gave me ſo many proofs of her gentle Spirit, that I reaſſumed my former paſsions, and afterwards did ſeek after, and deſire nothing elſe, but to ſee her at her door, at the Church, and at the place where ſhe was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to walk. She uſed me with all reſpects, knowing from what Family I was deſcended; And as often as I came to wait upon her, ſhe abandoned all other Imployments to give entertainment to me. But it ſo fell out, that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of Summer her favours did end with it, and when I came to her Fathers houſe to ask for her, ſhe was conſtantly denyed. This eſtrangement of her Company, and affections, I obſerved every day more and more to continue, and having heard her ſpeak heretofore of a certain Man whom I knew, who was called
<hi>Melibeus,</hi> I doubted ſhe had taken an Inclination unto him. He was a Player on the Lute, and had a Penſion from the King, and was one, who putting on his back all that he could get, was accounted amongſt the braveſt fellows about the Court. He was alwaies on Horſeback, and I on foor, and it was this which gained him the heart of inconſtant <hi>Diana.</hi> I underſtood a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>wards by one of my Friends (who had notice of it) of the familiarity

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> he had with her. I was very ſorry for her particular, for <hi>Melibeus</hi> could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> be a Suter to her for any good Intention, and if I had been her Father, I ſhould never have given way unto it; for it is known ſufficiently, that ſuch <pb n="18" facs="tcp:59287:70"/>libertines as himſelf do never Court young Gentlewomen to marry them, there being nothing more certain, than that Court-Humouriſts, Poets, and Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians (whom I rank under one Categorical notion) do never advance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at Court but by playing the Pander. It was therefore to be feared that <hi>Melibeus</hi> did indeavour only to gain <hi>Diana</hi> to proſtitute her to ſome young Lord, who might afterwards be a ſupporter to him, and this ſuſpition did carry with it a great probability of Truth. I was amazed at the error of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> to undervalue me for one who had nothing to commend him but only that he could play on the Lute, neither was he one of the Maſters in that faculty, for I who made no profeſſion of it could play altogether as well as himſelf. That which advanced him was his impudence, and hath ſince found another way that hath much inriched him, but the moſt diſhoneſt one in the world.</p>
            <p>One day he was ſo bold as to ſpeak unto the King, Sir, I do acknowledge that I am not worthy to ſerve you, but I have an extreme deſire to be found worthy, &amp; I hope I ſhall be able to arrive unto it, if you will be pleaſed to aſſiſt me. May it pleaſe your Majeſty to command that ſome moneys may be aſſigned to me to provide me with Inſtruments that I may be heard to play in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, there will not be a Lord in the Court that will not follow your exapmle. The King out of the bounty of his Royal Nature did accord to that which he demanded, and he did afterwards Petition to all the Lords of the Court. To one he Petitioned for a Violl, to another for a Lute, to this Man for an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farian, and to that Man for a Harp, and unto ſome for a pair of Virginalls: And after he had been with two or three who had anſwered his Petition, the reſt were all conſtrained to follow their Examples, for it would reflect to their diſgrace if they ſhould be found leſſe liberal than others; Nay there were not ſo much as any one of their Grooms, who did not contribute ſomething to him, for if he would be eſteemed a Man of ingenuity, he muſt adorn the Cabanet of
<hi>Melibeus.</hi> At the laſt he had not room enough in which to put all thoſe Inſtruments that were given him, he muſt therefore provide himſelf with a Magazine. For my part, if he had demanded any thing of me, I ſhould have been ſo prodigal as to have beſtowed upon him a Iews-Tromp. He had ſent his Lute-maker to a Lord, who had promiſed to pay for a Lute for him; The Lord payed a great deal more than it was worth, and the profit thereof returned to <hi>Melibeus,</hi> and afterwards the Lute-maker carryed the ſame Lute to another, and it was obſerved that the ſame Lute was payed for by eleven ſeveral Lords. This indeed did tend enough to his advantage, and he perſwaded Men to be cheated by example; but
<hi>Melibeus</hi> is not the firſt that did undertake to beg with Honour. Nevertheleſſe he did dutifully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige himſelf even to the leaſt of thoſe who had beſtowed gifts upon him, and if they had commanded him to play unto them, he did not fail to obey them. For all this he purſued his deſign, and did amaſſe together ſuch a multitude of ſeveral Inſtruments, that if he would have ſold them, as I believe he now hath, he might be the Maſter of a very conſiderable eſtate.</p>
            <p>Thoſe things were enough to render him odious to <hi>Diana,</hi> but ſhe was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome with vain apparences. You are not ignorant that Maids for the moſt part do love thoſe Men beſt who ſpeak moſt, not regarding whether they ſpeak good ſenſe or not. The Tongue of
<hi>Melibeus</hi> was a perpetual motion, and he had got in the Court a certain liberty which I could not be Maſter of, for I made love with ſo much modeſty that I durſt not take <hi>Diana</hi> the hand to kiſs it. But as I have ſince underſtood by one, who hath often ſeen him with her, he was not ſo reſpectfull. Moreover, when he was in her Company, he would ſhew himſelf to be very paſſionate, and would roul his eyes in his head, as thoſe little Figures under a Clock, who with their Hammers knocking on the Bell, do give an account of every hour of the day. He ſpake the Romance of a tranſported <hi>Phoebus,</hi> and would thus Court her, Let me kiſſe your fait <pb n="21" facs="tcp:59287:70"/>Hands my Fair, but O! How prodigious is the effect, they are of Snow, and therefore they do burn me. If I kiſſe thoſe ſweet Roſes of your Cheeks ſhall I not be pricked, ſeeing that Roſes are not without prickles. Much more he would expreſſe to the ſame ſenſe, which he had all by heart, his humour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always exerciſed in extravagant paſſions. When he was before the great Ladies of the Court, he would ſeem as if he were ſtruck with admiration, and would ſay unto them, Ah Madam, I loſe my ſigh in ſeeing too much of Beauty, and I advenrure to loſe my language with it, which in this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhment of my Spirit can no longer entertain you; He had ſpoken more truly, if he had complained of the loſſe of his underſtanding, but all was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in good part whatſoever he did utter, and thoſe things were ſuffered in him, which would have given juſt offence if they had proceeded from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>I do believe there was not any one but <hi>Diana</hi> that did eſteem him, although to ſpeak the truth I do believe he was not much inamoured of her. The Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Courtier was more agreeable to her than was my modeſty, and ſhe gave him all the occaſions that ſhe could to ſpeak unto her. She would be ſure to be at the Gate at thoſe hours in which he was accuſtomed to ride that way, and oftentimes ſhe would invite him into the houſe. I was poſſeſſed with a violent deſire to underſtand in what degree of favour I was with her, but ſhe returned anſwer ſhe was indiſpoſed in her health, and could not ſee any one on that day, wherupon I determined to borrow a Lackey of my friend, for I kept not one my ſelf, and he ſupplyed me according to my own deſire. I did ſend him to <hi>Diana</hi> as if ſhe came from <hi>Melibeus,</hi> to underſtand if ſhe were at leiſure, that he might wait upon her, ſhe returned anſwer, yes, and that ſhe ſhould be glad to ſee him. This being reported to me, I knew for certain that <hi>Melibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> did altogether poſſeſſe her heart, and that he had alſo gained the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her Kinſman. It much grieved me, I confeſſe, but I proteſt unto you I entertained rather thoughts of Indignation than of Iealouſie; For it ſeemed to me, that <hi>Diana</hi> forſaking me, and choſing <hi>Melibeus</hi> was ſufficiently puniſhed for her own blindneſſe, and why ſhould I be grieved at that for which ſhe ought herſelf to lament; I did comfort my ſelf with this, that to Court her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more was to imploy time to loſſe; ſhe will have a Courtier, let her there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore purſue and enjoy her own Fancie. I believe that if ſhe married accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as ſhe propounded to her ſelf ſhe would have the leiſure to repent it, For my ſelf, I aſſure you, I was reſolved to have her Epithalamy ſung by the Muſicians of the New bridge, after I had compoſed the Verſes.</p>
            <p>Intending to proſecute this humour, one Night I took with me five or ſix of my friends, and we did all go to give a Frolick to
<hi>Melibeus</hi> with Hammers, Drumms of Biſcay, and Iews Tromps. For my part I did ſing a prepared Song, in which I made mention that our inſtruments were as good as his, and might as much aſſiſt him to captivate the affections of his Miſtreſſe. Much more was ſpoken to his diſgrace, which I believe he underſtood, but he durſt not appear before us. I had a reſolution beſides to have given him a hundred Baſtinadoes before the face of his Miſtreſſe, there was nothing more eaſie if he had been worthy to have put me to that trouble. But I conceived it was poſſible that for all that <hi>Diana</hi> would not think the worſe of him, and as it ſtood that ſhe might poſſibly change him for another, as ſhe had changed me for him. For beſides the imperfections of his Mind he had many great ones of his Body. I have heard that <hi>Diana</hi> ofentimes would ſay; What a delicate Gentleman is this <hi>Melibeus?</hi> How ſweet He always ſmels? It is true, and, a Man might juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that he therefore ſmelt ill, becauſe he ſmelt well: He had a ſavour that was able to bring the Plague into the moſt temperate Air, and for all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes that were under his Armpits, the places where he had been did retain ſo corrupt a favour that an hour after he was gone the noyſomneſſe of the ſmell <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59287:71"/>might eaſily be perceived. I believe that the extreme and violent heats were return'd, and that the ſtrength of his Sweat did overcome the Perſumes. When he would kiſſe <hi>Diana,</hi> he would put ſweet Confects into his mouth, to correct the rottenneſſe of his teeth; And the beſt words that could be ſpoken muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bad in his mouth, he had ſo corrupt a Breath. But without any further amplification,
<hi>Diana</hi> herſelf did at laſt forſake him, and not long afterwards her Father married her to an Advocate, a rich and an honeſt Man, in whoſe arms I had rather ſee her, than in thoſe of <hi>Melibeus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was ſ conſcientious that I would not attempt to violate the Marriage bands, and I found my affections to her nothing ſo paſſionate as before, ſo that if I did ſpeak one word or two unto her, that was all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Love nevertheleſſe did preſerve the Empire he had got on me, and cauſed me to adore another Beauty, the acceſſe to whom was far more difficult, but the enjoyment was more eaſie. After her, I loved many more, of whom I will not ſpeak, the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will too much trouble you; It may ſuffice, that for the greateſt part of them our affections were reciprocal, and there was not any of them but gave me the teſtimony of a vehement paſſion, in granting me their deareſt favours. There doe not ſhine ſo many Starrs in the skies, as I was enlightned with the eyes of ſeveral beauties. My Soul was inflamed with the firſt object that appeared, and of fifty beauties which I had often in my fancy, I could not diſcern which was moſt agreeable to me. I courted them all at once, and if ſometimes I received from any one the leaſt diſguſt, it did ſo afflict me, as if my Love had been moſt entire, and but to her alone. Peradventure I anon ſhall give you an account of ſome part of my affections, accordingly as in order they ſhall preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the following Hiſtory.</p>

<hi>Francion</hi>) I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came infinitely acquainted with young Men of all Conditions and Eſtates, as the Sons of Noblemen, the Sons of Juſtices, the Sons of the Kings Receivers, and of Merchants. We every day did meet at the Ordinary, and my Authority was ſo great amongſt them, that I purſed up more than I expended. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to five or ſix of the moſt noble of the Number, to make as great a Company as we could of generous and gallant Perſonages, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to Ignorance and Folly, that ſo we might converſe together, and ſhew innumerable proofs of our noble Reſolution. My advice did pleaſe ſo well, that immediatly putting their hand unto the Work, they did draw a great number of their friends together, who alſo did bring in others with them of their particular Acquaintance. We made Lawes which were inviolably to be obſerved, as to ſhew all honour unto one, who from fifteen dayes to fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen dayes ſhould be choſen the Chief of the Company; to aſſiſt one another in Dangers, and Loves, and in other affairs; to deſpiſe all fordid thoughts, and the vile Rabble in <hi>Paris,</hi> who believe there is a great neceſsity of their ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Offices; all thoſe who would obſerve theſe Ordinances, and others of the ſame ſtrain, were received into the number of brave and generous, for ſo we ſtiled our ſelves, and it was no matter if any one amongſt us were the Son of a Merchant, or an Exchequer man; for the abuſe of Traffick only, and of the Exchequer Men were to be blamed. We look'd not on Deſcent, but Merit; We made Feaſts by turns; for my ſelf I was exempted from that charge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was the Founder of the Fraternity; and being the firſt who was made Chief, I had the charge to receive the Fines in which they were condemned, who had fallen into ſome error which they were forbidden to commit. The money was to be imployed for Collations in the Afternoons, but God knows how juſt a Treaſurer I was, and how I ſaved the money to ſupply my own neceſsities: My Companions were ſo prodigal, and ſo full of money, that they freely emptied their purſes, and demanded not an Account of my Receit. I was as brave as the braveſt of them all, and braver too; It pertained to me on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſee Juſtice done on the peremptory perſons of the City, whoſe ſcourge I was, as if for that purpoſe I had been ſent down from Heaven.</p>
            <p>The Son of a Merchant, but the moſt ignorant and preſumptuous one in the world, did one day come into the Company where I was, he was moſt richly <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59287:72"/>cloathd with a Silk Stuff that could not be paralleld in <hi>France,</hi> I believe that he cauſed it to be made in <hi>Italy,</hi> on purpoſe becauſe he thought no man in <hi>France</hi> ought to be equal to him; I obſerved how loftily this young Merchant did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himſelf, and that although he was ſaluted with much reverence, yet his own Hat would ſtir no more than if it were ſome piece of unwieldy timber on his Head. Being always an Enemy to ſuch humours, I could not endure this ſight, and ſpake aloud to thoſe who were next unto me, pointing to him with my ſinger: See there (my Companions) the principal ſhop of Monſieur
<hi>Hui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtachius</hi> (for ſo according to his name I did call his Father) ſo God ſhall ſave me, ſee if he hath not laid forth his very beſt Stuff on his Stall: He is like to gain well by it; for we need not go home to his Houſe to fee the richeſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, His Son there is a Shop errant, and doth go up and down to ſhew it to all the World. Coming up unto me, he ſaid, with an angry and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning countenance, Speak you of me? I, laughing at him, ſaid to my Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Gentlemen be not offended at any thing he ſaith, He did verily believe that there is ſome one amongſt you who is like unto him, and doth deſerve that he ſhould be ſpoken unto as I have ſpoke unto him. Finding himſelf to be hit home, he did ſwear Bloud and Death, and ſaid, that although he did not wear a Sword as I did, and that it was not his Profeſſion, yet he would—And there he ſtopt without ſpeaking more.</p>
            <p>For my ſelf, I made uſe of his Rage to improve my laughter, and intending to make more ſport with him, Certainly (ſaid I) it is good diſcretion, the more infectious and more foul the thing is, to take ſo much the more care to cover it, nevertheleſſe the evil ſavour will come ſtill unto us. Becauſe you will needs appear in ſuch rich Habiliments, it is a ſure teſtimony that you have nothing elſe that can purchaſe reſpect unto you. You would fain ſeem to be ſomething tranſcendent, and to ſurpaſſe all gallant Men, but underſtand, that if your Body be above theirs, their Souls will riſe aloft and will mount above yours. One of my Companions came then unto me, and deſired me to let him goe. So I will (ſaid I) I have little reaſon to diſpute againſt a Suit of Cloaths, for I can ſee here nothing elſe againſt which I ſhould quarrel. The Sword is not worth ſo much as the Scabbard, and to ſpeak the truth, It is reaſon that ſo fair a Cloak ſhould be ſeen in ſome more eminent place than where it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced to be worn; I will pardon him, but upon promiſe that he ſhall enter no more into conteſtation with things that are above his capacity, nor med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle but with ſuch Cloathes as are fit for his condition.</p>
            <p>My Simplician fearing after I had afflicted his wretched Spirit with my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective Mirth, I ſhould perſecute his Body with my Baſtinadoes, dis fly away as ſwiftly as doth a guilty perſon who is purſued with Sergeants.</p>
            <p>And as fair examples doe follow one another, the next morning being at a Counſellors Gate with his Daughters, and ſome other good company, a young Man of the City who was very ſpruce paſſed by: He had a Doublet on of white Sattin, and Stockings of Crimſon Silk, in brief, he was in all tings accommodated like a Gentleman, ſave only that he had no Sword, and yet he had one, but he cauſed his Lackey to follow behind him with it. Behold (ſaid I) the cuſtom of the young Gallants of <hi>Paris,</hi> they will be all after the garb of the Nobility, and renounce the Vocation of their Fathers, which is the principal cauſe of their Riches; but certainly yonder fine thing hath no extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary deſire to appear a Gentleman, he doth ſo little love arms, that he will not own them, unleſſe they are carryed behind him; and moreover, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that he would have it known, that his Lackey is more honourable than himſelf, for he makes him to carry the Sword. There was not one among my Companions who did not applaud the conceit, it was ſhot home ſo handſomly; And becauſe we had good Laws as well as words, and our remarkable actions ought to be recompenſed, it was ordered by them all, that out of the mony I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59287:72"/>I ſhould reſerve ſo much as would buy me a Beaver Hat, which they thought I had well deſerved by reaſon of the many Gallantries which I had put in execution.</p>
            <p>We did ſharply correct Vice, with the edge not only of our Tongues, but ſometimes with our Swords, and without Mercy we did charge on thoſe who had offended us; It was no eaſie adventure to oppoſe us; for the moſt part we did go ſix and ſix together, and ſometimes all in one Company, as when we did go a hunting out of the City as far as <hi>Bois de Vincennes.</hi> It is true I had no Horſe, but one of my Companions who was the Treaſurers Son did always lend me one when it was our pleaſure to be on Horſeback.</p>
            <p>Many times in the night we would beſtow Muſick on the Ladies, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes we made Masks, and danced them in the beſt Houſes of the City, where in emulation we contended for the improvement of our new virtue which could not be parallel'd. The Citizens condemned our practice, Men of courage did approve it, every one did ſpeak diverſly of it according to his Fancy. Our exploits were the ordinary diſcourſes at the <hi>Lovure,</hi> at the Palace, and all publick meetings. He who would ſhew himſelf to be of a generous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, would rank himſelf in our Company, or deſire our aſſiſtance. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Lords were glad of our Friendſhip, when of themſelves they would puniſh ſome who had offended them, and they intreated us to chaſtiſe Vice according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as we declared. Nevertheleſſe in proceſſe of time this ſociety of ours did loſe is Luſtre, and the greateſt part being forced to withdraw, either to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide ſome Office to maintain them, or to be marryed, and being afterwards to be ſetled in ſome courſe of life they could no longer continue with us.</p>
            <p>It is true, the number was again compleated by the acceſſe of new Gallants, but they were ſuch a fraternity as diſpleaſed me. Their Souls panted after nothing but vanity and beaſtly debauchment. I did admoniſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them, when I was with them, and by little and little I did refrain their Company, counterfeiting my ſelf to be indiſpoſed in my health, for the which purpoſe, I, for the moſt part, confined my ſelf to my Chamber. I did there addict my ſelf to my Study, and after the neweſt, but the beſt faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all, I did altogether play the Philoſopher, and did contemplate on the condition of men, and what they ought to do to live in quiet, and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully than now they do, concerning which I had drawn the beginning of a Treatiſe, which I will communicate unto you. I leave you to judge if that be not the cauſe wherefore I do ſo much deteſt the converſation of Men, for by this Study I found the means to make them live like little Gods, if they would but practiſe my Counſels.</p>
            <p>But becauſe we muſt firſt aſſay to ſatisfie the deſire with thoſe things which are croſſe to ſenſuality, I only did endeavour to procure contentment to my ſelf. Afterwards extravagantly determining to follow in apparence the track of others, I made uſe of a deceipfull Art to obtain the good Will of every one. I endeavoured to make my mouth ſpeak contrary to what my heart thought, and would give complements and praiſes where I thought moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for my own ends, receiving that liberty to my ſelf to ſpeak to thoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who were worthy of them. I had a deſire to addreſſe my ſelf to ſome great Signior, who might give me a condition that might render my Fortunes more aſſured, but I had never the deſire to ſerve thoſe perſons who were not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to command, for I was well enough acquainted with the evill conditions of the Court.</p>
            <p>One of my Friends did bring me one. Afternoon to the Houſe of a Damoiſel called <hi>Luci,</hi> aſſuring me that ſhe was a Woman of the beſt diſcourſe that could be, and that I ſhould not fail to find in her Company the braveſt Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in the World, amongſt whom I ſhould have the Honour to illuſtrate, and the happineſſe to advance my ſelf. She had underſtood of him who I was, and <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59287:73"/>that I came on purpoſe to viſit her, wherefore ſhe gave me good entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and placed me next unto her; there were preſent divers perſons clad moſt gallantly, who I conceived were not the leaſt of the Court; I liſtned to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the good diſcourſe which I conceived they did maintain: On all ſides I heard nothing but Vantings, Extravagancies, and a confuſed Gallimaffry of Accounts ill reported, and a pronuntiation ſo bad, that it cannot be repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Is is not a ſtrange thing, Madamoiſell, (ſaid one of them) twirling his Muſtachio, that good Fortune and I ſhould be always at War, ſhe will never lodge in my Company; If I had all the Silver which the Treaſurers of
<hi>Spain</hi> have in their Coffers, I ſhould loſe it all at play in one morning. It is a ſign (ſaid <hi>Lucy</hi>) that the Starrs will ſuddenly ſhoot down a more happy Influence, and intreat Love to metamorphoſe your ill Fortune in play, into a good Fortune by a rich Wife. I know not, ſaid the firſt, what Edict Heaven will iſſue forth concerning that, but I will ſend a challenge to you as my Enemy, if you open not the portal of your Soul to this Belief, that if I am favoured by Deſtiny in my Marriage, I muſt be married to a Lady ſuch as you are: You do mock me ſure, ſaid
<hi>Lucy,</hi> taking him by the hand in hers, and ſmiling at what he ſaid; He replyed, I will give you marks more viſible than the Sun, that I do cheriſh you with a moſt real Love; My heart is alwayes toſſed in a Sea of Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred millions of Thoughts to the gluttonous appetite of the Weſt, and South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt of my Deſires, until (moſt delicate Beauty) I ſhall make known unto you that I do adore you with ſo fervent a devotion, that—He there made a ſtop, being at a halt in his Conceptions. Theſe words he did ſpeak in <hi>Lucies</hi> ear, to ſhew they were very ſecret, but by an admirable Vanity he did pronounce them ſo loud, that every one did hear them, for he conceived to himſelf that they were moſt exactly ranked.</p>
            <p>Not long afterwards, changing his Diſcourſe, he ſaid, My Soul was lately ſo bigg with deſire to have a piece of Land which pleaſed me, that I gave for it Three hundred thouſand Liuvers, although it was worth no more than Two hundred and fifty thouſand, and ever ſince I have a great Deſire to be called by the Name of that goodly Heritage. Good God! ſaid I to my ſelf, What is this? A Man who thinks himſelf one of the braveſt in the world, is ambitious to carry the Name of a few Acres of Land, when the Land ſhould be known by the Name of the Maſter of it. How ridiculous is this abſurdity? Why doth he not rather purchaſe ſome gallant Title by his atchievments? Turning my ſelf to the other ſide, I obſerved two in a ſerious Diſcourſe, which made me the more attentive. What is your judgement (ſaid one of them) on my Suit of Cloaths? Is it not of an excellent ſtuff, and as good as ever was made at <hi>Lyons?</hi> Is not my Taylor well verſed in the Faſhion? He is a Man of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and I will advance him if I can; There is a Citizen hath a good Office in the Exchequer, who is not to be compared to him. But what think you of my Hat? Doth the Faſhion of it pleaſe you? Alas Sir, (anſwered the other) I find all things you wear to be extremely compleat, that the more I doe contemplate you, the more I am raviſhed with admiration; I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the Angels are not better cloath'd in Heaven, than you are on Earth, although they have every one of them ſix Ells of Stuff of a sky-colour, embroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with Starrs, to make them a Suit. Good God! You are <hi>Adonis</hi> himſelf, What deep ſighs doth
<hi>Venus</hi> fetch for you? What a charm do thoſe Roſes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on your cheek? The two even Ranks of your white teeth have power in them enough to murder a heart. Nevertheleſſe, Excuſe me if I tell you, Sir, that your Hat doth flap a little on the one ſide thereof, The Brims are with the largeſt, Cauſe them to be cut more narrow, Let me be your Counſellor of Eſtate in this affair, I ſpeak unto you as a Friend; Far be it from me to diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage you, I ſee well enough that you are accoutred with other rare Vertues, for you have a pair of Boots the beſt made in the world, and (above all) your <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59287:73"/>hair is ſo well curled, that I believe the Soules therewith intangled, and made priſoners, do wander up and down as in a Labyrinth of Pleaſure. The other kiſſing his cheek did reply, Deareſt of my Friends, You better deſerve thoſe praiſes which you give me, than my ſelf, It is known to the world that your brave Qualities do cauſe you to be cheriſhed, even by Majeſty it ſelf; You are the Loadſtone who attracteth all, both Male and Female, to you at the Court: The Ladies, for all their inexorableneſs, are wounded with the Arrows of your Eys, and acknowledge they feel no ſires, but what are lighted from your beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The other made anſwer to him with a ſtrange boaſting, It was true e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough there were ſome Ladies who did love him, and to give him a proof of what he ſaid, he did pull out of his pocket a Love-letter, which, it is poſsible, he did write himſelf, although he ſaid, It came from his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe.</p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe was nothing pleaſing to me, I therfore turned aſide to the Conference of ſome others, which was not much better. They judged of the affairs of State, as a blind man doth of Colours: And he who ſpake of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres of Land, thinking himſelf to be the moſt judicious in the Company, did affirm, That ſince the King diſmiſſed him of a Lieutenant ſhip which he had, there hath been nothing but Diſorder in
<hi>France,</hi> and that he was the Man who for ſo long a time did maintain the Kingdom in peace. Afterwards they came to ſpeak of War, and every one of them did make a relation of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary exploits he had performed. There were ſome of them who ſaid, That their Pages were called Squires, to ſhew only in what reputation their Maſters were, and if they committed any Imployment to their charge, it was to ſhow that they were moſt deeply ingaged themſelves.</p>
            <p>I was ſo weary to ſee and underſtand their a piſh follies, that I would have given any thing to be gone; At the laſt, they all ſtanding up to ſalute a Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior called <hi>Clerantes,</hi> who was newly entred, I found the opportunity to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape away in the Confuſion, having made a ſhort reverence to the Company, who I thought had taken no great notice of me.</p>
            <p>At my departure having met with him who cauſed me to goe in, I told him, That the Gentlemen whom I had ſeen, had no doubt a great deal of Eloquence with them, but it was according to the condition of this Age, in which, to ſpeak much is to ſpeak well but there was nothing ſo ſottiſh or vain as their Spirits, &amp; that if the Court had not more generous Perſonages, I was well contented not to trouble it; and, that I abſtained from talking, not the better to underſtand them, or to gain from their language or experience, but becauſe I would not adminiſter an occaſion to be troubled to diſcourſe with them, which would have proved more tedious to me, if particularly they had addreſſed themſelves unto me. I related to him how I obſerved their Vanity, uſing ſeven or eight affected words at the beginning, middle, and the end of every clauſe, which they thought to be courtly, and very gracefull, when it was moſt ridiculous, as, Sir, Moſt undoubtedly you have the whole Property of it. You are acute in Love and Muſick. You have all the habitudes with the Miniſters of the affairs of State. You are in a very good Poſture with Monſieur the Treaſurer. You are here in the great Commerce of the world. You are intricate, and not to be fathomed; and ſuch other terms newly invented. The Anſwer which my Friend did make unto me, was, That by the train of the Lackeys at the Gate, be knew what perſons were in the Houſe, and that they were Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who were eſteemed to be the beſt wits in
<hi>France,</hi> to which I made Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, That in the Country of the Blind, he who hath but one eye is King there.</p>
            <p>But as ſince I have underſtood, <hi>Clerantes</hi> knowing me, becauſe elſewhere I had been ſhewn unto him, demanded of <hi>Lucy,</hi> If ſhe received not much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in my Company; for, ſaid he, I am informed that this Gentleman makes <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59287:74"/>very good verſe, and hath the cleareſt fancy, and the ſmotheſt language, and the livelyeſt accents in the world. I have heard it ſo ſpoken, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> but nothing leſſe appeared to me, I believe it was his Statue ſent hither by Art Magick rather than himſelf. I ſaw, I muſt confeſſe, a dumb motion which made no anſwer to what I demanded of him, but only by nodding of its head, and in the ſame manner departed without the leaſt complement. You ſhall find (ſaid <hi>Clerantes</hi>) that ſomething diſcontented him; who was it that gave you the knowledge of him? <hi>Lucy</hi> made anſwer it was the Gentleman who did bring him to her houſe. Some few days afterwards
<hi>Clerantes</hi> ſpake unto him, and according to his directions I repaired unto <hi>Clerantes</hi> with an intention to make it appear unto him who I was. I did accoſt him with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements ſuitable to his quality, and entertained him above two hours with diverſe Subjects without appearance of being tedious to him. At the laſt I ſhewed him my verſes, which he told me did pleaſe him better than ever any that he ſaw at the Court. After that, ſpeaking to me of <hi>Lucy,</hi> he told me, ſhe complained exceedingly, that taking the pains to viſit her, I would not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to open my mouth to feed her ears with the ſweetneſſe of my diſcourſe. The generous diſpoſition of this Signior did invite me to conceal nothing from him, I told him, that if I were Maſter of thoſe rare qualities which were impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me, yet I could not be perſwaded to ſpeak at that time, becauſe there were ſome Gallants with <hi>Lucy,</hi> to whom good and ſolid diſcourſe would be as the Sun amongſt the blind. He confirmed what I ſaid, and vowed to me, that they were a generation of men vain and ignorant, nevertheleſſe I might have diſcovered my ſelf to <hi>Lucy</hi> without being interrupted by them, for I ſhould have found in her another Genius. Not long afterwards having taken me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him, I perceived that the praiſes given to her were anſwerable to her deſerts, alſo ſhe confeſſed again and again, that by my diſcourſe ſhe found me to be ſuch as my friends had repreſented me unto her.</p>
            <p>Much about that time there was a Libel brought to the hands of
<hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes,</hi> playing with much freedom on almoſt all the great Perſonages of the Court, <hi>Clerantes</hi> himſelf was alſo comprehended in it, but all it could ſay of him, was, That being married to a handſome Lady he deſiſted not to ſeek his fortune elſewhere. I pauſed a little to examine that piece in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and marvelouſly did paſſe my Iudgement on it. I will venture my life, ſaid I, it was <hi>Alcidamore</hi> that cauſed this to be made. Wherfore think you it was rather he than any other? ſaid <hi>Clerantes.</hi> I will tell you, ſaid I, you will not deny that he it the moſt vicious in all the Court, and yeſterday I heard you to affirm as much. Now thoſe who are not named in this Satyre are exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their remarkable Vertue, but as for him, I know not for what reaſon the Poet left him out, but only for this, that by his perſwaſion he did write it. My conjecture was very probable, and <hi>Clerantes</hi> was of opinion that I did ſpeak the truth: On that he took other Verſes out of his Pocket, which he found lying at his feet in the Louvre, and had not yet read them all over. Whiles he was ſpeaking to one of his friends I did run them over with a curſory eye, and perceived that they were made directly on himſelf, and reproached <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes,</hi> as being ſtupid, ignorant, and a mortal Enemy to Scholars. Sir, ſaid I, I do beſeech you to give me leave to burn this paper; I will not, ſaid he, until I throughly have peruſed what it doth contain. I replyed, they are the moſt notorious lies in the world. I will ſee them howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſaid <hi>Clerantes.</hi> They wil exaſperate you moſt extremely, ſaid I; Not at all, replyed <hi>Clerantes,</hi> if they juſtly accuſe me I ſhall receive an advantage by it, and ſhall hereafter indeavour to render my ſelf ſo virtuous, that I ſhall make Envy mad, that ſhe hath no more an occaſion to turn her arms againſt me. But on the contrary, if I am condemned without a cauſe, I ſhall no more regard the ſlander, than a generous Lyon doth fear the barking of little Dogs, they may draw near unto me, but they dare not bite me. Having ſpoke thoſe words I <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59287:74"/>took him aſide, and obſerving the greatneſſe of his courage, I made no demur to give him the Paſquill. Having read it, he ſmiled upon me, and ſaid, A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> what Lyars are theſe to make the World believe that I love not Letterd men, either they know not the learning which you have, or are ignorant how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I eſteem you. I thanked him for the favour which he teſtified unto me, and demanded of him, if there were not a Poet lately who demanded ſomething of him to which he could not accord? He pauſed a little while, and then ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, It is not above three months ſince a certain man did preſent me with a Copy of Verſes in my praiſe, for which I promiſed him fifty Crowns, but ſome of my People have reſtrained my liberality. Be you ſure then (ſaid I) that it was he who made thoſe verſes in indignation thereupon, I do partly ſuſpect the man, and now I remember my ſelf, I can aſſure you that at this time he is a Servant of <hi>Alcidamors,</hi> and that it is he no doubt who did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the other piece. That may well be (ſaid <hi>Clerantes</hi>) when he came hither he did ſing me no other Song but that he would render me immortal if I ſhould crown his indeavours with ſome honeſt recompence. I cryed out, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las poor ſeller of immortality! your Merchandiſe is not of an allay good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. The Verſes which you made but ſix years agoe are already in their graves. It it true, he vaunted there was not any but himſelf alone who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons ſharp enough to take hold of the Rock, and to climb up unto the top of <hi>Parnaſſus.</hi> Sir, ſaid I, when we do feed upon a hard cruſt of bread we doe think to our ſelves that we do make a great noiſe, when none who ſit by us do hear any thing at all: ſo it is with this poor Rimer, his works make no noiſe but in his own ears. Let us examine the piece without regarding the Subject on which it treateth. We have already condemned him for that.</p>
            <p>After that, I ſhewed to <hi>Clerantes</hi> all the faults of the Satyr, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him that I would anſwer it to take away the evil impreſſions which the Courtiers might have received of him. On the other ſide <hi>Clerantes</hi> inforced himſelf to prove all thoſe Lyars who for the time to come ſhould accuſe him of ignorance, and he reſerved two hours every day to be in his Cabanet with me to learn how to diſcourſe in company, on all variety of Subjects, and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner than the greateſt part of Courtiers do, whoſe diſcourſe is without Order, Iudgement, or Politeneſs. Not to diſſemble, he before in ſome degrees did hate good literature, nay, and he blamed ſome perſons who did addict themſelves unto it, thinking that it ought not to be the exerciſe of a noble Spirit; But I took from him that imagination, demonſtrating unto him with much reſpect, that thoſe who would command others ought to have more ſtrength of Spirit than of Body, as it is ſeen amongſt brute Beaſts. And to revenge himſelf of the Poet who contumeliouſly had abuſed him, be cauſed him to be ſoundly baſtinadoed.</p>
            <p>His good will increaſing day after day towards me, he was curious to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after my Fortunes; I made my ſelf more poor unto him than in effect I was, to induce him with a more ſpeedy and open hand to aſſiſt me, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of him that I might have my reſidence with him. He offered an honeſt exhibition, which I accepted, becauſe I had my liberty entire; and although I did him ſervices, and ſuch peradventure that he could not expect from any other, yet I was not in the quality of a Servant. He promiſed that he would always eſteem me as a friend, wherefore I did put my ſelf into his houſe, where I received infinite proofs of his liberality, and was accoutred with moſt gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous habiliments. I was ordinarily mounted on a Horſe worth one Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Piſtols, and when I did ride, the earth did ſeem almoſt to tremble under me; I was always followed with three or four Lackeys: My Mother was filled with contentment at the news of my good fortune with which I had acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her in my Letters. I took vengeance on thoſe who heretofore had upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me, by deriding them in the ſame nature. Of my old Camrades there was <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59287:75"/>but two or three left of whom I made any reckoning, For the reſt, I did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to cheriſh them, by reaſon of the profit I received from them, (which is an Invention that ſometimes we ought to practiſe, without the fear to incur any juſt blame.) I deported my ſelf no more with any familiarity towards them, to make them underſtand they were nothing in compariſon of me, and that they render'd themſelves diſtaſtful to me by their Imperfections. This gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Society did not long after diſperſe themſelves, wanting one of Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and Courage to maintain them in their flouriſhing eſtate. The Girls alſo who before undervalued me, would now be proud of my favour, but I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their hypocriſy with reproaches.</p>
            <p>My ordinary Cuſtome was to chaſtiſe Folly, to ſuppreſſe Vanity, and to mock at the willfull Ignorance of Men. The Lawyers, the Receivers, and the Merchants, paſſed daily under my hands and laſh, and you cannot imagine what pleaſure I took to ſtrike home at the black Sattin. Thoſe who ſaid they were Noble, and degenerated from it, were not exempted from the juſt effects of my choler; I did inſtruct them, that to be Noble was not to ride a Horſe well, or to handle a Sword, to man a Hawk, or to make a Dogg, nor to jut it in the ſtreets with rich accoutrements, but to be the Maſter of a Soul which reſiſts all the Aſſaults and Buffets of Fortune, and to have nothing ſeen that is baſe in any of his Actions. It ſeemed to me, that, like <hi>Hercules.</hi> I was born to chaſe thoſe Monſters from the Earth: Nevertheleſs, to ſpeak the truth, there was no hope for the performance of it; for I muſt then deſtroy all thoſe Men, who now have nothing of a Man in them, but the figure only. I reſembled alſo, methought, the other <hi>Hercules</hi> of
<hi>France,</hi> who drew Men unto him by the ears with the chains that proceeded from his mouth; I ſpeak it without Vanity, that thoſe who have heard me diſcourſe with that modeſty which I alwayes obſerved, have ſometimes been gently drawn to entertain my Counſels.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Clerantes</hi> had done any thing for which I did fear he ought to be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, my Reproof was ſo gentle, that it gave no occaſion of offence and it was alſo ſpoke in privat. It is ſaid, that when
<hi>Diogenes</hi> was to be ſold amongſt the other Slaves, he cauſed the Cryer to Cry, Is there any one who would buy a Maſter? whereupon he who bought him, ſuffered himſelf to be governed by him, receiving thoſe Inſtructions of Philoſophy which he gave him. In the ſame manner was I in the ſervice of a Maſter, who nouriſhed me, and gave me a good allowance, and I did exerciſe authority over him, and commanded him to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from many things, and I deported my ſelf in a way that was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſagreeable to him, and no man elſe could poſſibly give him more thriving Counſel.</p>
            <p>As I was one Morning in the Court, there came in a Man cloathed modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough, who deſired to ſpeak with him. His Servants, who underſtood that I poſſeſſed <hi>Clerantes</hi> altogether, did ſend him to me, to know, If he might have free acceſs unto him. This man being about five and thirty years of age, and very grave in his words and geſture, was taken by me to be one of ſome Quality, I brought him all along the Entry to the door of <hi>Clerantes</hi> Chamber, and bidding him go boldly in, I return'd to my own affairs. In a moſt humble poſture he ſtooped to
<hi>Clerantes,</hi> and ſaid unto him, Sir, The extreme Deſire which I have to do you ſervice, joyned with that to ſee my ſelf delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the perſecutions of ſome of my Kinred, doth cauſe me to come hither, to beſeech you to receive me under the wings of your Protection, in ranking me in the number of your Servants. I demand neither gage nor recompence, if I have but my life it is ſufficient; I can promiſe you I ſhall be able to perform thoſe good Offices which you cannot expect from others. Sir, I am licenſed in the Laws, and one of the Kings Advocats, and I underſtand good Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſo well, as to ſerve my turn on all occaſions. Moreover, I have Courage <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59287:75"/>enough, and if neceſſity ſhall require me to take the Sword into my hand, I will acquit my ſelf as well as any Gentleman in your ſervice. <hi>Clerantes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, I have not the leiſure to ſpeak unto you now, but I thank you for the good will you have to ſerve me; if my Family had not its full number and charge of Officers, I ſhould imploy you in the beſt way I could. The man hearing this refuſal, with ſtaring eyes made anſwer to him, If you knew my Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, you would be ſo far from making a difficulty to entertain me, that you would intreat me your ſelf to be one of the number of your Family, but I perceive you deſerve not to be attended by ſuch a Man as I am. Thoſe out ragious words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
<hi>Clerantes,</hi> he commanded thoſe who were about him to take him away by force. They took him by the Arm to turn him out of doors, but they could not get him thither; ſo that <hi>Clerantes</hi> commanded them to let him alone. Being at liberty, he ſat down in a chair, &amp; having a little while kept ſilenc, &amp; uſed ſome extravagant geſtures, he thus madly expreſſed himſelf To thee it is that I would declare my ſelf, magnificent Signior, and ſpeak unto thee three words, as long as the way from
<hi>Orleans</hi> to <hi>Paris:</hi> Thou knoweſt well enough that the Fire which in a Dew mounteth on high, doth environ the head of the
<hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> of thy Renown, and that the Serpent
<hi>Python,</hi> who covered all the Earth, inſomuch that the Maſons had no room to build any more houſes, was ſlain by quiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing <hi>Apollo.</hi> O the great and fatal blow! The Crowes for joy did dance to the Sound of the Hoboyes, and the three Halberdiers who were their Leaders, did play on the Cymbal, to pleaſe the Hares of the Hills. As for thee, my Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious, the
<hi>Anthropophagi</hi> do thee great wrong, and the Elementary fire ſhall never quench thy thirſt, although thy Phyſician with a noſe as red as a Lobſter doth perſcribe thee to flea an Eel by the tail, and to roſt it againſt the Wind with the end of a great Log that ſhall go directly into
<hi>Germany</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt unto the Proteſtants that Chitterlings do fly like a Tortoiſe, and that on the year paſſed we ſhall ſee the Water of <hi>Seine</hi> ſold more cheap than the blood of a Bullock. Having ended this goodly Speech, he did begin to laugh as loud as poſſibly he could, and you may believe that thoſe who heard him did not forget to doe the like, but
<hi>Clerantes</hi> Chamberlain did laugh more loud than any, which the Advocate perceived, and having given him two or three ſound blowes with his fiſt, he ſaid unto him, Canſt thou not hold thy Peace thou ignorant? Doſt thou think I came hither to make thee laugh? Hold your peace all of you, ſaid
<hi>Clerantes,</hi> I obſerve he hath ſome buſineſſe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to declare unto me. I will relate unto you a little Fable, ſaid he, which ſteals into my Fancy from the backward ſhop of my Brain. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cochymick
<hi>Aeſop</hi> hath nothing of it. The Eagle more mindfull of Prey than Honour, did one day mootch from the Thunder which lame <hi>Vulcan</hi> had made, as crooked as himſelf, for Almighty <hi>Iupiter.</hi> A very fool the Eagle was to commit ſo great an overſight, for every one did honour him before as the bearer of thoſe Arms with which that great God doth puniſh all offences, but be took more pleaſure to be at freedom, and plunder the Inhabitants of the Air. <hi>Iupiter</hi> being angry took two Pigeons, and did prefer them to the ſame Office in which the Eagle was. This is enough Gentlemen to inform you, that the Court ſhall know if it pleaſeth, that my cauſe is right enough, it being grounded upon an Hypotheſis. It was
<hi>Saturn</hi> himſelf who played his part on my ſide when he was a Sergeant; There came a great Thunderbolt which troubled all things. The Sun fell into the Sea with fifty Stars who were his Pages. They drank ſo deep, that in the twinkling of an eye you might ſee them lye all dry upon the Sands, which is the place from whence ever ſince we have received their light. After that I threw my hat amongſt the Stones, and I know not what is become of it, or any thing elſe.</p>
            <p>In the purſuce of this humour he did ſpeak a thouſand times without reaſon, by which it was perceived that he had a troubled brain.
<hi>Clerantes</hi> concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59287:76"/>that I was he who brought him to his Chamber, did imagine I had done it to give content unto him; having called me, he underſtood that I knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the diſtraction of the Man. But to put the Advocate in a good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mout, I cauſed all thoſe idle fellowes to depart the room, who did too much incenſe him with their petulancies; I did ſpeak friendly and pleaſantly unto him, and giving him reſpect, I did ſeem to a dmire his words, which did invite him to return as pleaſing words to me, and I did put on ſo diſcreet a Reſtraint that I did not ſeem to laugh at all.</p>
            <p>On the ſame day there came certain men to demand him, his Servants brought them to <hi>Clerantes,</hi> to whom they declared that he was their Kinſman, and had a troubled Spirit for the grief he received in the loſſe of all his eſtate, being overthrown by his Adverſary in a Sute of Law, and that in charity they would provide for him in their own houſes, although he had done them great miſchief in the violent fits of his diſtempers. I will eaſe you of that trouble, ſaid <hi>Clerantes,</hi> he is come to offer himſelf to me, I have a deſire to retain him, and give him good uſe. His Kinſmen being glad to be diſcharged of him, did leave him with <hi>Clerantes,</hi> who immediatly did give him th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> name of <hi>Collinet,</hi> and commanded that he ſhould be apparalled like a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>There paſſed away ſome Weeks before he fell into his exceſſe of madneſſe, and during that time he would deliver himſelf very acutely, and ſometimes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eloquently, although to ſpeak the truth he was always extravagant in his Diſcourſe. The prohibition which was given to all the Servants not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe him by their provoking words, was the cauſe that he did not leap into his rages, nor become to miſchievous, as he, and others of his diſtemper are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to be: One could not but receive coutentment in his Company, and there was not any man of quality who came unto the houſe, but would be glad ſometimes to liſten to him, and to ſee him perform ſome pleaſant actions.</p>
            <p>I was his only Governour, he called me good Maſter, and
<hi>Clerantes</hi> good Lord. When I would touch any one to the quick, I would by one artifice or other diſcover his vices to him, of which he would afterwards upon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion give ſo lively a Character, that many who heard him diſcourſe ſo to the purpoſe, would believe that he was not out of his wits, but counterfeited.</p>
            <p>In his youth he had ſo clear a Spirit, that the marks thereof did ſtill remain. Sometimes he would give admirable anſwers without any inſtructions of mine. Having heard us to ſpeak of a Signior who was baffled in his reputation, and yet was accounted by ſome to be an affable and a courteous man, he mantain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he was the moſt diſcourteous man in the World, the reaſon being demanded, he ſaid, that the day before he obſerved him to be ſo incivil, that he would not go out of the way to give his Brother the upper hand, who, to his knowledge, was more aged, and more deſerving than himſelf. It being told him that he miſtook, for that Signior had no Brother at all. He made anſwer, I do know he hath many Brothers, and he that paſſed by him was one of them, he was one of the gallanteſt Aſſes that ever I ſaw. Another time as we were making a motion to play at dice, he ſaid he would not play againſt the Signior, becauſe he always carryed an Ace under his Doublet. Having met him one day in the <hi>Louvre</hi> he approached to him, and gave him hay out of his Pocket. The Signior turning to him, and asking him what he did mean by it, Make much of that which I give you, ſaid <hi>Collinet,</hi> it will prove good food for thee in time of neceſſity. The Signior was ſo full of Honour that he would not be angry, but did turn it into laughter: But not long afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be revenged of him, he called him to him, and did command him to hold his Fauchion for him a little while. <hi>Collinet</hi> having drawn it, The Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior took it out of his hand, and did put his foot upon the blade, as if he would have broken it, Whereupon <hi>Collinet</hi> cryed out, Behold Gentlemen the great <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59287:76"/>miracle which is done to my Sword, I brought it hither without any Hilts, or defend five guard at all, and now, ſee, they have put the greateſt Aſſe unto it in the world. Diverſe Gentlemen at that cry did run thither, which was the cauſe that the Gentleman who took the Sword from him, did leave it with him, and departed in a great confuſion, being reſolved to aſſault him no more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his replyes were ſo ſharp and poynant.</p>
            <p>As we were ſpeaking one day of a Woman, who every day did inlarge her Husbands horns, he made a thouſand conceits upon it. He ſaid, that ſhe ought to be afraid leſt he ſhould gore her with the Arms of his Head when he was offended at her: And as for himſelf, he might have buſineſſe enough to find Hats that would fit his Head; and that he ought to make his doors higher to enter therein with eaſe, and without ſtooping. And but obſerve his ſubtilty, he ſaid that <hi>Astaeon</hi> had Horns, not becauſe he ſaw <hi>Diana</hi> naked, but they came to that Cuckold becauſe he had not the curioſity oftentimes to behold his own Wife naked. He underſtood that a light Huſwife had a Child, for which no Father could be found: You are to conſider, ſaid he, that ſhe hath been in the Army, and her Champions having all drawn in her defence, ſhe knows not in the ſcuffle who it was that gave her the blow. He compared her alſo to one who had pricked his hand by touching thorns, and could not tell in the whole buſh which was the thorn did hurt him. Having heard of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Girl who was great with Child, and no Man could tell who was the Father of it, You may be ſure, ſaid he, that ſhe is <hi>Helena,</hi> and ſhe is great with child by
<hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hearing us to ſpeak of nocturnal pollutions, He ſaid, we were puniſhed by the night, for lying on our backs. <hi>Clerantes</hi> running at the ring, at the Royal Palace, ſome who were preſent did ſay he did run with ſo much ſpeed, that he did leave the wind behind him. That may be true enough, if I may give the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it, ſaid <hi>Collinet,</hi> Without all doubt my Maſters Horſe did break wind when he was running in the Liſt. Sometimes he would undertake to make verſes, as you know that Poetry and madneſſe are near of kin: He reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Verſes to a Gentleman who came often to <hi>Clerantes</hi> houſe, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that he was to marry, he offered to make the Epithalamy. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman meeting him not long afterwards, ſaid unto him, Oh Maſter <hi>Collinet,</hi> How doth your Muſe, you told me you would pipe ſomething at my Wedding; Pipe, ſaid he, Upon my Faith, you and I can both of us make one good inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; You ſhall provide the Horn, and I the Pipe, and of that you may make a Hornpipe. The Gentleman who had hardly been married three days, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry angry to hear himſelf ſo ſoon called Cuckold, and was much abaſhed at it. Not long before I made mention to you of <hi>Melibeus</hi> who loved gentle
<hi>Diana.</hi> He came often to <hi>Clerantes,</hi> and although he would fain be in favour with me, I could not endure him, when I remembred how he traverſd me in my firſt Loves, which came often into my mind, with an infinite number of other pleaſing thoughts; for you know the firſt impreſſions will never be forgotten. I often ſpake to <hi>Collinet</hi> of him, ſo that he did abuſe him more than any other, whereat
<hi>Clerantes</hi> took great pleaſure, for <hi>Melibeus</hi> was accounted but a Buffon at the Court, and he muſt ſpeak to our Madman whether he would or no, or otherwiſe he would have played upon him. Their diſcourſes were filled with Injuries and extravagant reproaches, according to their ſeveral ſubjects; It will be too difficult to give you an account of them in particular, I ſhall only relate unto you the moſt lively and pleaſing paſſage which happened between theſe two, who were one of them almoſt as wiſe as the other: <hi>Melibeus</hi> ſitting one day at
<hi>Clerantes</hi> Table, they cauſed <hi>Collinet</hi> to ſit by him, that they might diſpute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. <hi>Collinet</hi> ſpake whatſoever he could to <hi>Melibeus,</hi> to which <hi>Melibeus</hi> did anſwer very coldly, being then in a more melancholy humour than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. Dinner being ended,
<hi>Collinet</hi> obſerving that he would give him no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59287:77"/>did quit the Company, and retired himſelf into his own Chamber, where all the day afterwards he was conſtrained to do Penance, becauſe he was not permitted to come down into the Hall, as long as his Maſter was there preſent, having not 2 days before come down into the Kitchin, and beaten there a little Page whom his Maſter loved very dearly.
<hi>Melibeus</hi> being adviſed of it, would call him to an account for ſome affronts which he had given him, and thought now was the time to put his Revenge into execution, he therefore coming up the ſtairs over the Hall, where his Chamber was, did pinch him on the arms, and tweak'd him by the noſe, and did ſpeak unto him ſuch opprobrious words, that he took a good Cudgel in his hand, and began to charge him home with it. <hi>Melibeus,</hi> who had nothing to defend himſelf, did conceive that his ſureſt Courſe was to take his Farewell of the Chamber, and to run away: Therefore to teſtifie his ſpeed, he leaped down the Stairs three by three, but
<hi>Collinet</hi> purſued him, and at every leap did overtake him with a ſound blow, either on his head or on his ſhoulders. When he was almoſt at the Bottom of the ſtairs he made a little pauſe, and with his hat in his hand, making a moſt humble Reverence, he ſaid unto him, Sir, I do beſeech you to excuſe me, that I doe not wayt upon you to the Foot of the Stairs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am forbidden to paſſe any further; otherwiſe you may aſſure your ſelf, I would expreſſe my ſelf moſt diligent in my attendance on you. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpoke thoſe words, he returned into his Chamber, and <hi>Melibeus</hi> did make as much haſt down as before, without the leaſt regard unto the Complement of <hi>Collinet.</hi> It grieved me not at all to ſee <hi>Melibeus</hi> ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated: and becauſe he appeared to be in a good humor, <hi>Collinet</hi> his Enemy being gone, I deſired him to repeat by heart thoſe Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which heretofore he had uſed to
<hi>Diana.</hi> He had not forgot one of them; and becauſe he would act them with the greater grace, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Clerantes</hi> Page to ſit down, to perſonate the part of <hi>Diana,</hi> and did court him in the very ſame Complements: And if at any time he fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or extravagantly did proceed, following the Caprichiouſneſſe of his own Fancy, I did demonſtrate to him how he ought to ſpeak it, and did act his part for him. <hi>Melibeus</hi> did ſwell with deſpite, to ſee how I did play upon him for his old Love, but he durſt not return a word, becauſe he obſerved it was agreeable to
<hi>Clerantes.</hi> At the laſt, being able no more to endure our Scoffs, he by little and little did withdraw himſelf from our Company, and came no more unto us.</p>
            <p>Behold how <hi>Collinet</hi> here had aſſiſted me to take vengeance of a Man, who, to ſpeak the truth, had offended me in the moſt ſenſible part of my Soul. This Fool, who had ſo many Rational Intervalls, was profitable to me in many other things. He ſometimes would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of things which would ſerve us as good Counſel in our moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant affairs, accordingly as it is ſaid, <hi>That Wiſe men learn oftentimes more of Fools, than Fools can know to learn of Wiſe men;</hi> Who will deny but that his words were Oracles, when he ſhall underſtand what I am now about to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count unto you?</p>
            <p>One day being in the Chamber of <hi>Clerantes,</hi> having obſerved a ſtatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Courtier who importuned his Maſter with humble Intreaties, to do a Courteſie for him which lay in his power to perform, He took a Bisket out of his Pocket, and did ſhew it to a little Dogg that was in the Chamber; The Dogg did leap upon him, did lick him, and did ſhake his tayl, and ſeemed to demand the bread of him. But he did lift up his Arm as high as he could, and with an extravagant Voice, cried out, What! You would have me give it you, would you? You ſhall not have it. Give it him
<hi>Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> ſaid <hi>Clerantes,</hi> who looked on them, for he hath deſerved it by his obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiouſneſſe. I imitate you Sir, Signior
<hi>Clerantes</hi> I imitate you, ſaid <hi>Collinet.</hi> 
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59287:77"/>In what do you imitate me, ſaid <hi>Clerantes?</hi> In this, replyed
<hi>Collinet,</hi> that you muſt be intreated and flatter'd, before you will grant that Man what he would have, who now ſpeaketh to you. It is a great pleaſure that you take to ſee your ſelf importuned; I am of adviſe that you ought not too ſoon to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of that pleaſure. The Means we muſt uſe to maintain it, is not to give that which is demanded of us, or at leaſt to hold off the Petitioners as long as civilly we can; After we have once granted them their deſire, they will court us no longer, as I will ſhew unto you by Example. Having ſpoke thoſe words, he threw the Bisket to the Dogg, who did run under the Bed to eat it, which being done, he came back again to <hi>Collinet</hi> to demand more. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, ſaid
<hi>Clerantes,</hi> to make much of you again, you do wrong to accuſe him of Ingratitude. After he knows that I have no more to give him, he will leave me I will warrant you, ſaid <hi>Collinet;</hi> And ſpeaking thoſe words, he kicked him with his foot, which made him run away, and he return'd no more to make much of him again, although he often call'd him to him. Obſerve now, ſaid <hi>Collinet,</hi> all thoſe petitioning people who come to wait upon you, they are all of the humor of your Dogg, therefore take heed of them. Thus
<hi>Collinet</hi> was the Cauſe that his Maſter, underſtanding that Fools do ordinarily Propheſie, did make much of his advertiſement, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came afterwards an extraordinary Husband.</p>
            <p>At that time the Troubles began again in <hi>France. Clerantes</hi> was amongſt the Principals of one Party, which cauſed many to be much diſcontented at it. <hi>Collinet</hi> was not well pleaſed neither with the Warr to which <hi>Clerantes</hi> was inforced to go; He therefore diſcovered to <hi>Clerantes</hi> what he thought of it, as he came out of a Chamber, being called thithet to Counſel by ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages of eminent Quality. My good Lord (ſaid he) Theſe Counſellors are all Men of the Long Robe, they never ſaw any battels, but in Pictures, or in Books; If they were worth any thing, they would never perſwade you as they do, to eſchew Peace. Do they know the Deſolations which do follow the events of a Battel? one hath his Arm ſhot off, another hath his Head cloven aſſunder, others are trampled under the Feet of the Horſes, and many die, being mad with Rage. I repreſent this unto you, becauſe I believe you are no more experienced than themſelves in the affairs of Warr. You are not to be blamed, if you refuſe to aſſiſt in this Service of the Warr; for what Glory is there in it? The braveſt Man in the world is oftentimes laid on the Ground by a Bullet from a Musket, which peradventure ſome Coward did ſhoot to begin his Apprentiſhip in the War. If <hi>Caeſar, Alexander, Amadis de Gaul,</hi> or <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemain</hi> did live in theſe days, they would not engage themſelves ſo willfully as heretofore they did. Their ſubjects alſo having need of their perſons, would diſſwade them from adventuring themſelves in ſuch deſperate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters. For my ſelf, I delight not in Murder, and had rather be preſent at the Death of Pullets than of Men: Let us therefore return to <hi>Paris,</hi> and make good chear: It is better to ſee Broaches than Pikes, and Pots than Drums, and the Utenſils of a Kitchin, than the Utenſils of Warr. Your Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment muſt be, to ſee if the Canons be well mounted. If the Troups of Horſe be well quartered; but in <hi>Paris</hi> your March is only to ſee handſom Ladies with whom delightfully you may paſſe away your time.</p>
            <p>Although that <hi>Clerantes</hi> did turn all his Diſcourſe into Laughter at that preſent; yet afterwards he made profit of it, as of a ſecret advertiſement which Heaven did ſend unto him by a Man in the midſt of his Madneſſe, and approved of what he did allege, as if they had been the pregnanteſt Reaſons of the profoundeſt Philoſophers in the world.</p>
            <p>Peace being made we returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> where
<hi>Clerantes</hi> addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the fair, and the fair-ſpoken
<hi>Lucy,</hi> he did find in her more powerfull charms than ever, and was ſo ſtrongly enamour'd of her, that he never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59287:78"/>departed out of her houſe. One day he took with him
<hi>Collinet,</hi> having put him into a frolick humour, by the means of two or three glaſſes of Wine which he had cauſed him to drink more than ordinary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Collinet</hi> did ſometimes behold her beauty, which infinitly did pleaſe him, and ſometimes he would look upon his Maſter who ſtill did conſtantly gaze upon her: At the laſt he obſerved that his Maſter did caſt down his eyes on <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> Breaſts, to ſee her Paps between the ſmall openings of her Handkerchief, which did inflame him with a vehement deſire. <hi>Collinet</hi> taking more notice of it, did take a pair of Cizers from the Chambermaid that waited on her, and gently approaching unto <hi>Lucy</hi> did cut the ſtrings with which the Handkerchief was made faſt, and took it from her. She turned to him to reprove him for his impudence, but he immediatly did prevent here, and ſaid, You do much wrong to my Maſter, to conceal that from him which he hath ſo great a deſire to behold, let him look his fill; and if you will be perſwaded by me, you may permit him alſo to touch your Breaſts. You ſee, ſaid <hi>Clerantes,</hi> I cannot fail for an Advocate, my cauſe is ſo good, that it is even able to defend it ſelf, nevertheleſſe I am not aſſured to gain it, becauſe you are both the Judge and the party that is intereſted alſo. I know not what to think of it, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> for your Advocat doth uſe a rude violence with his Hands, and no ſmooth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion with his Tongue. <hi>Clerantes</hi> obſerving that
<hi>Lucy</hi> was not contented with that action, did whiſper her in the ear, and acquainted her with his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which greateſt Princes do pardon in ſuch perſons, without taking ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception at what is done. In a moment ſhe was appeaſed, and ſeemed glad to have the Company of <hi>Collinet,</hi> of whom from diverſe perſons ſhe had heard much before. <hi>Clerantes</hi> deſiring to make her merry with him, did command him to begin ſome diſcourſe to entertain the Company. Having ſeated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a Chair he immediatly began in this manner, with admirable action and rouling of his eyes. Lady, your Merit which ſhines like the Lantern of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe, is ſo able to obſcure the Ecclipſe of the morning, which begins to appear in the Hemiſpere of the Lycanthropy, that there is not a Gentleman in all the Court, who will not be content to be curld by the Northern wind to pleaſe you. Your Complexion doth ſurpaſſe the Onions in redneſſe. Your Hair is as yellow as the excrement of a young Infant. Your Teeth which are not one of them taken out of the Carmelins ſhop, do ſeem to be made of the Shoeing Horn of ſome great Prince. Your Mouth doth open and ſhut like a Trunk. To be ſhort, <hi>Phoebus</hi> being at Supper at <hi>Coifles,</hi> and to pay ſix Piſtols for his Ordinary, doth not eat better Paſties made of Chitterlings than thoſe which I do taſt of. And as <hi>Achilles</hi> did draw the Son of <hi>Priam</hi> about the walls of <hi>Troy,</hi> ſo doth the Court drag me to be inſtalled in her favour: but I will beat her ſoundly for it with the Brims of my Hat, although ſhe better doth deſerve to be ſtrappadoed.</p>
            <p>I know not what you make account to doe, ſaid
<hi>Clerantes,</hi> Tell me <hi>Collinet,</hi> Did not you aſſay to diſcourſe upon the perfections of Madamoifelle? why do you not perfect what you undertook? I am going about it, ſaid he, Go too then. Fair Nymph, ſince I muſt praiſe you, I will tell you that you have cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tived me; it is ſufficient: for you ſhall never captive me again, although you had as many attractions about you as be Oranges in <hi>Kormandy.</hi> Alas I muſt confeſſe all, or my heart will break. The Devil take you to advance his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, if (Lady) I am not more amorous of you than a Beggar of his Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let; when I ſee you I am raviſhed as a Hog that is piſſing in a Stye. If you pleaſe, in ſpite of <hi>Rowland</hi> and <hi>Sacripant</hi> you ſhall be my <hi>Angelica,</hi> and I will be your <hi>Medor,</hi> for there is no doubt but the greateſt part of the Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are more beaſts than the beaſts that carry them. They do not imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at all, not ſo much as in one exerciſe of virtue, they do nothing elſe but throw three or four ſquare bones upon a Table; and I have not yet ſpoke all.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59287:78"/>The other day with a pair of ſpectacles of
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> I diſcovered as far as the Iſle where all the Souls of thoſe diſſolute fellows go which are metamorphoſed into horrible Monſters. As for the Ladies, they cauſe themſelves to be tickled and tickled again, without dreaming of Repentance, they are laid on their backs in the inner Chambers, and the outward Chambers, and in the Garrets, and never think how hard the Plancher is; and they thruſt in ſomething, I know not what it is, under their Coats, It is their Busk that I doe mean.</p>
            <p>This goodly Panegyrick was concluded with this Song, <hi>So long you goe ſweet Guilmott,</hi> and with that, <hi>you ſpoil me there</hi> with <hi>Pimpalo,</hi> which he ſung with ſo loud a throat, and made ſo diſmal a noiſe, that he made <hi>Clerantes</hi> deaf, who commanded him to entertain the Company with a more civil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; Whereupon he began to talk again at random, and intermingled his diſcourſe with ſome truths that had relation to the Court, which made all the Company to laugh outright. In the mean time there came in a man cloathed in black Sattin, who was not well pleaſed at the affronts which <hi>Collinet</hi> had put upon him, for he told
<hi>Lucy</hi> that he had a Face which repreſented ſome antient Medal of a Cuckold, and that his Noſe was made like a Tray, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he took
<hi>Collinet</hi> aſide by himſelf, and whiſpered him in his ear that
<hi>Clerantes</hi> might not hear him. Maſter Madman, you counterſeit your ſelf to be out of your wits, but if you meddle with me I will have you ſoundly whipped into your Senſes again. It was well for him that having ſpoken thoſe words he immediatly departed the Room, for otherwiſe
<hi>Collinet</hi> who began to grow into a great choler would have done him a ſhrewd turn. On his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn he did give me a faithfull account of his adventures, which I ſuddenly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and making mention of the Gentleman in black, I found that he was full of bitterneſſe and libell, I promiſed him upon my faith that I would take his Cauſe into my protection, and be fully revenged of his Enemy, although I did not then know who it was. And juſt as I could wiſh it, walking one Evening in the Street with my Train about me, whereof <hi>Collinet</hi> was one, I perceived a far off one of the Treaſurers who not long before had detained from me the moyety of a Sum which I was to receive, and to requite him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his deſerts, I did ſhew him to <hi>Collinet,</hi> and told him that undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly he was the Man who had affronted him in <hi>Lucies</hi> houſe. He who did believe me, did ſuddenly arm himſelf, taking two Eggs from a Chandler at the next door, which he did thow at his face, and ſpoiled his worſhipfull Pickadilly, which was ſet forth like a Peacocks tail. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he gave him ſix or ſeaven ſound blowes on the Noſe, which made him bleed like a Bullock. I paſſed directly on without ſo much as looking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me, that no man might conceive I had any hand in the Tumult. My Lackeys did not then follow me ſo cloſe as they were accuſtomed, they all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed themſelves to aſſiſt <hi>Collinet,</hi> againſt whom the Treaſurer took the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to revenge the indignity he had received, they aſſaulted him with their Batoons, whiles our Madman reſting himſelſelf did look upon them, and ſaid, you will not threaten to whip one any more? Do you remember it Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Villain. The Citizens who knew the Treaſurer did aſſemble themſelves to reſcue him from the Lackeys, who (to avoid their fury which had armed them with ruſty Halberds) did ſay unto them, Gentlemen, that diſhoneſt man did abuſe one of <hi>Clerantes</hi> Gentlemen, It is he whom you ſee yonder; yes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, ſaid <hi>Collinet,</hi> I am a Gentleman belonging to <hi>Clerantes;</hi> At the name of <hi>Clerantes</hi> they all made a ſtop, and my little youths one after another did eſcape away, leaving their Enemy covered with blood.</p>
            <p>I made uſe alſo of <hi>Collinet</hi> to puniſh many other unworthy fellows who in vain addreſſed themſelves afterwards to
<hi>Clerantes</hi> to make their Complaints of him, who gave them no other anſwer, but that they muſt not regard the actions of a Madman. There was one who told him once in a reproving way of admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59287:79"/>that he ought to keep him locked up in his houſe, that he might no more affront thoſe whom he met in the ſtreet. I at that time was preſent, and obſerving that <hi>Clerantes</hi> did not like that Counſel, and made a pauſe to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what anſwer to return unto it, I ſaid unto him, Sir, Whatſoever they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, Shut not up your Madman until the People are become wiſer, he is of marvellous uſe to tame the pride of ſo many vile Spirits as are now in <hi>France,</hi> whom he knows by a certain Inſtinct which Nature hath imprinted in him. <hi>Clerantes</hi> approving my Reaſons, neglected the advice which was given him, and <hi>Collinet</hi> more than ever did jut it in the ſtreets, being ſo richly apparrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that he was taken for ſome Baron, but the people were never more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed to ſee him, than when ſometimes he ravingly would fall into the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Follies.</p>
            <p>At that time the Allurements of <hi>Lucy</hi> had more and more inthralled the heart of <hi>Clerantes,</hi> and inforced him to ſeek out a Remedy; and becauſe he underſtood that I was well practiſed in the Art of Love, he was willing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his paſſion unto me, which I did perceive before. He told me that he had a Deſire to imploy me in that affair, and did more eſteem of my particular Merit, than of all the Men in the World; And that he would not imitate the greateſt part of the Court, who were accuſtomed to put ſuch affairs into the hands of the moſt Ignorant and abject perſons: for he knew that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be provided with a Man of an extraordinary underſtanding for the carrying on of ſuch an enterprize, and that Lovers ought to eſteem thoſe as their tutelar Gods, who do procure them to arrive at the happineſſe they doe ſo much deſire.</p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe which tended to my advantage, did invite me to promiſe to be aſſiſtant to him in all things, for my heart panted after nothing more than thoſe ſweet Pleaſures, with which I was glad to ſee him ſo much poſſeſſed: But <hi>Lucy</hi> had a Gentlewoman that followed her, called <hi>Florence,</hi> who was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlatively beautifull, whom I moſt paſſionately loved, which cauſed me to take a great delight to go oftentimes unto her Miſtreſſes houſe with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only to look on her. In my judgement ſhe had farre more temptations than her Miſtreſſe, who was but black in Compariſon of her. I know not what
<hi>Lucy</hi> did think of it, unleſſe ſhe truſted altogether on the charms and the enticements of her own Spirit, which indeed were capable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to cauſe her as highly to be eſteemed by thoſe who did ſpeak unto them both together.</p>
            <p>I counſelled <hi>Clerantes</hi> to go no more to <hi>Lucy,</hi> until ſhe was willing to grant unto him the favour he deſired, becauſe to preſerve his Reputation in the eye of the world, he ought to diſcover as little as poſſibly he could of the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Love, ſeeing the ſottiſhneſſe of Men is ſo great, that they all run on that Bias which they ought not to do, and believe that the viſible marks of a gallant Spirit, are thoſe of a deformed One.</p>
            <p>He did not contradict what I ſaid, for I was his only Oracle, and mauger all the Men of the World, he was determined alwayes to follow my Counſels. Having therefore reſolved to deprive himſelf for a certain time of the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentation of <hi>Lucies</hi> Company, the Queſtion was to find Expedients to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his paſſion unto her, which as yet he had not done. He though it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to ſend a Letter of Love unto her, which he gave me Commiſſion to dictate for him; for (not to flatter him) his diſcourſe was not poliſhed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for <hi>Lucy,</hi> whoſe Spirit was Politeneſſe it ſelf; I told him that I would draw up his Letter in ſuch a faſhion, that in addreſſing himſelf to his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe, his greatneſſe ſhould receive no blemiſh, for he ſhould ſhew a Spirit more frolick than ſerious, it being not expedient that he ſhould deſcend ſo low, as to make apparent the tranſportations which are commonly found in the expreſſions of true Lovers. I come now to tell you the Contents of the Letter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:59287:79"/>
               <q rend="inline">
                  <hi>If your beauties were not extremely abſolute, you ſhould never have the power to have ſurprized me, becauſe I have made a vow to preſerve my liberty entire. Underſtand (Rare Mervail) the advantage you have purchaſed, and give thanks to your merit for it. Conſider that the Gods have not given you the Prerogative to inflame all hearts with love, without feeling the leaſt spark of fire in your own. I dare ſay they ſhould be unjuſt in ſo doing. To what intent ſhould they beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you ſo many perfections, if they ſhould not teach you how to make uſe of them? It would be only to torment Mortals, in ſhewing them the chief work of their hands, and taking from them the hope to poſſeſſe it, after it hath filled them with a world of deſires. Be not cruel to your ſelf, in loſing that time which you may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy to your greateſt advantage. You have made no love as yet, but in words only, begin it now in effects with me, who breath after the happineſs that you ſhould take that reſolution; you will taſt of new delights, which it is poſſible you have not yet thought of, becauſe as yet you have not had the experience of them, We will paſſe away the days in imbraces and kiſſes, you ſhall receive from me thoſe hommages which ſhall fill you with glory and pleaſure; I will ſhew my ſelf ſo ready, and ſo able to render you the greateſt ſervices which a Lover poſſibly can promiſe, that you ſhall receive more content than your imagination can propound unto your ſelf. Follow my counſel dear <hi>Lucy,</hi> the light of my eyes, Reſolve to do as I adviſe you, and make an aſſay of the pleaſures of Love, and ſet a guard no more unprofitably on the preſents of Nature. If you had but the leaſt knowledge of the affection which I do bear unto you, I doubt not but you would make choice of me to make you ſenſible what are thoſe pleaſures of which I do ſpeak unto you.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>With this Letter I ſent alſo a Copy of Verſes to her, which ſo lively did repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the delights of Love, that the devouteſt Woman in the World would have been moved, when ſhe did read them, with the titillations of the fleſh. I leave it to you to judge if this gallant young Lady were not touched with them; ſhe did bite her Lips in pronouncing the words ſoftly to herſelf, ſometimes ſhe would ſmile, and her eyes would ſparkle with a ſudden tranſportation. I who obſerved all her actions, took great pleaſure to behold her, believing ſhe would return ſome favourable anſwer to <hi>Clerantes;</hi> but inſtead of doing it ſhe turned it all to ſport, and took not the Pen in her hand to write back an anſwer unto her Lover. Nevertheleſſe ſhe greatly eſteemed what he had ſent her, and did commend it for a very good piece, and knowing by the ſtile that it was none of his own, ſhe ſtrongly conjectured that I was the Author, and loved me inſtead of loving him who breathed forth ſo many ſighs for her, and ſaid unto her ſelf, Since <hi>Clerantes</hi> hath not the wit to repreſent unto me himſelf the pleaſure, of Love, it is a true ſign that he cannot make me to taſt of them. As for <hi>Francion,</hi> whoſe ſtrain hath traced them out unto me, I believe he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands better what is to be done. The proofs which I ſee of his Civility do infinitely attract me. By thoſe things which happened afterwards, I preſume that ſhe thus diſputed within her ſelf.</p>
            <p>Her Intention was afterwards diſcovered to me, when ſpeaking to her of <hi>Clerantes,</hi> Why <hi>Francion</hi> (ſaid ſhe) and laughed, Have you made a vow to Heaven to ſpeak never for your ſelf, but to procure good to others altogether? No, Lady, I aſſure you (I made anſwer) It were a great folly for me to look on the fair Mark which my imperfections tell me I muſt never look to hit. There is no place ſo high, or ſo retired (replyed ſhe) in which you may not be made moſt welcome, if you have a deſire unto it. If I have a deſire to be entertained in your favour (ſaid I) ſhall I hope to arrive to the Butt of my deſign? Oh God (ſhe anſwered) do not ſpeak of me, I muſt not put my ſelf for an example, I am none of thoſe marvellous beauties which have that worth in them to attract your affections.</p>
            <p>Although ſhe diſſembled her deſires, I perceived well enough whither they did tend, and ſo gallantly I did aſſault her, that at the laſt ſhe rendred her <pb n="18" facs="tcp:59287:80"/>ſelf, and confeſſed to me, that ſhe reſerved for me that good will, which I deſired for another. Although I was not ſo paſſionate for her as for <hi>Florence,</hi> yet finding an occaſion to enjoy a pretious and a ripe contentment, I did tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle my ſelf, and perſwading my ſelf to believe that ſhe was more beautifull by far than ever before ſhe ſeemed unto me to be, I with my own hand did wound my own heart for her.</p>
            <p>I followed her ſo cloſe, that one Evening finding my ſelf all alone with her in her Chamber, ſhe gave me free permiſſion that I ſhould kiſſe her, and kiſſe her again, and ſhew unto her how judicious was the election which ſhe had made of me to be her Servant, and having the opportunity to begin that ſweet exerciſe, we greedily did make uſe of it.</p>
            <p>If ſome ſevere Cenſurer ſhould now hear me, he would ſay that I was perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to play the wanton with her, having promiſed
<hi>Clerantes</hi> to gain her good will for him: but what a ſottiſhneſſe were this; for if I ſhould let ſlip ſo rare an occaſion, I ſhould have deſerved to have been mocked by all the world. My own pleaſure ought to be more near unto me, and I am to be more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it, than of the pleaſures of another.</p>
            <p>You do believe (I do aſſure my ſelf) that the familiarity which I had with <hi>Lucy</hi> did take me off from courting any more her beautifull Servant, but you are infinitely deceived, for I loved her ſtill more paſſionately than I am able to expreſſe, and in whatſoever place I did meet her, I did not fail to teſtifie as much unto her. Her gentle heart was at laſt overcome by my ſubmiſſions, and by the Preſents which in ſecret I gave unto her; Nevertheleſſe we could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us find the opportunity to ſolace our ſelves, becauſe ſhe never ſtirred from her Miſtreſſe.</p>
            <p>Heaven one day ſo ordained it for my happineſſe, that
<hi>Lucy</hi> entertained ſome of her Kinred in her chamber, who continued with her many hours. I was juſt come within her doors, when beholding
<hi>Florence</hi> upon the Stairs, ſhe called me up to her Wardrop, where I kiſſed her at my own leiſure; I threw her on the Bed, and prevailed ſo far, that I proceeded further. But chance did turn, and the Deſtinies immediatly did ſhew themſelves to be unpleaſed with me; <hi>Lucy</hi> having a deſire to withdraw her ſelf a little upon ſome private occaſions, did go out of her Chamber, and came into the Wardrop, where we were, having opened the door which was double locked, ſhe ſaw her Maid putting down her Petticoats, and comming off from the Bed. A Natutal Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milion did cloath her cheeks, as well by the vehemence of our action, as for the ſhame ſhe had to be thus diſcovered, and beſides that her hair was diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and hanging down beneath her ſhoulders. <hi>Lucy</hi> looking on her, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of her if ſhe came from ſleep, and proceeding in her diſcourſe ſhe drew open one of the Curtains of the Bed to ſeek out the Chamber pot, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me pulling up my Breeches on the farther ſide of the Bed; She demanded of me what I did there, I made anſwer to her without any ſtammering at all, that I came to her Maid to have her mend the pleats of my Breeches that were ungathered. She made anſwer, you ſhould have gone more into the light, and to thoſe who make profeſſion of ſuch work. Do you think to delude me? On the other ſide ſhe obſerved that her waiting Gentlewoman had her Breaſts all open, and her Gorget unpinned, becauſe I had a deſire to kiſſe her Breaſts, which made her more fully to take notice of our treſpaſſe. How now, you lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle piece of impudence, ſaid ſhe, do you bring in young men hither to take your delights with them? you do diſhonour my houſe, It were a good deed to beat you. If I muſt be puniſh'd for ſuch a ſin (ſaid <hi>Florence</hi> very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently) being in that extremity, You do deſerve as great a puniſhmenc as my ſelf; and if the houſes were diſhonoured where ſuch things are committed, you have diſhonoured your own houſe as well as my ſelf; I will not tell you how, for it belongs not to me, nor is it for me to take notice, or inform how
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59287:80"/>things go within. I have done nothing which you have not given me an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for, and for more alſo; all that you can allege, is, that being not of ſo great a quality as your ſelf, peradventure it is not lawfull for me to aſſume unto my ſelf that liberty which you injoy.</p>
            <p>This bold anſwer made <hi>Lucy</hi> more aſhamed, becauſe it proceeded from her whom ſhe intended to have reproved, and caſting a diſcontented eye on me ſhe did goe out of the Wardrop, and violently clapped the door together. For all her jealouſie I ceaſed not to make good uſe of my time, and did not leave the Company of <hi>Florence</hi> until one hour afterwards: I did demonſtrate unto her, that we muſt finiſh the work which we had begun, and if we had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, yet as great a ſuſpition would lie upon us, as if we had done what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever could he imagined. Her Miſtreſſe howſoever did not dare ſpeak unto her of any thing for fear ſhe ſhould diſcover that ſhe was guilty of the ſame Crime, of which ſhe accuſed another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clerantes</hi> who ſtill importuned me to ſollicite her by any manner whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to grant him a remedy for his Love, did conſtrain me to write unto her a Letter more paſſionate than the former, but daring not to deliver it my ſelf, I did ſend it to her by another hand. She thinking throughly to be revenged of me, did write unto <hi>Clerantes,</hi> that by ſingular proofs ſhe did take a full knowledge of his affection to her; And not many days afterwards <hi>Clerantes</hi> coming to her, he obtained his deſires of her, of which I was more glad than <hi>Lucy</hi> did conceive.</p>
            <p>I could never entirely ſettle my affection on one Lady, becauſe I could not find any who deſerved to be perfectly loved, and nevertheleſſe all thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt whom but caſually I incountred, did powerfully captivate my affections, although in the judgement of all the world they were not guilty of much beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If any of my friends ſeeing me to look upon a Girl, did ſay unto me, You are amorous of her, I immediatly became ſo, although before I never ſo much as thought whether her beauties carried any charmes with them or not; my affections were all of them of no long continuance, and one object did make me to forget another. I arrived at laſt to the knowledge of a certain Woman of an excellent complexion, to whom I did participate all my deſires, ſhe was a Citizens Wife of <hi>Tours,</hi> and was come to <hi>Paris</hi> to follow a Sute in Law; She was a gallant Woman, and of ſo great an underſtanding, that her Husband being troubled with the Gout, did imploy her to ſollicite his affairs for him; One of my friends bringing me to the acquaintance of her, I found her fit for my purpoſe; and to oblige her to me, I made uſe of all my friends to follow her Sute, and to diſpatch it according to her deſires. This Courteſie accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with my Courtſhip did eaſily gain her, and I had my pleaſure at very little or no expence. To ſpeak the Truth, ſhe was a delicate Woman, but when I found that ſhe was not contented with one Servant, and began to affect others as well as my ſelf, I made no more eſteem of her, but by little and little retired my ſelf from her converſation, without demanding of her if her law bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe were almoſt brought to an end, or not, or if ſhe were ready to return to her own Country.</p>
            <p>Three Months paſſed away without receiving the leaſt tydings of her, when being in bed one morning, I ſaw her enter into my Chamber attended by two Citizens Wives, who ſeemed to be two antient Votareſſes in the Temple of <hi>Venus.</hi> I was lodged in an out part of
<hi>Clerantes</hi> houſe, and there was an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent from the Street but of one pair of Stairs to my Chamber, ſo that without any hinderance, or the leaſt examination, they came confidently up to my Chamber door. I entertained them very civilly, and cauſed chairs to be brought for them to ſit down near unto my Bed. I demanded of them what important affair had obliged them to come ſo early to me, ſince they had commanded me no ſervice to perform for them? My old Sweet-heart uſing her <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59287:81"/>cuſomed familiarity did ſpeak for them all, and ſaid, Sir, The occaſion that hath brought me hither, is, that being inforced to return to <hi>Tours,</hi> I was loath to depart without taking my leave of you, having received ſo many teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of affection from you. I am conſtrained to come to ſee you, becauſe you will not take the pains to viſit me, and it doth ſeem to me that you are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to forget her whom ſometimes you have profeſſed to have loved moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely. I have brought with me two honeſt Gentlewomen of my acquaintance, becauſe I would have my acceſſe unto you more aſſured, being but a Stranger, and comming unto ſo great a houſe as this, where there are ſo many people. I did thank her in the beſt manner that I could for the good will ſhe did bear me, and did beſeech her to excuſe me that I had ſo long diſcontinued her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which I imputed to a ſickneſſe which for a long time had confined me to my Chamber. But preſently ſhe changed her courſe of ſpeech, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me off from my Complements, ſhe ſaid unto me, Sir, That I may languiſh no longer under the unquietneſſe that I feel, permit me to ſpeak one word unto you which I have upon my heart. You know that on my firſt arrival to this City, you came acquainted with me, and I granted you all the favours which a Man can deſire, and if any thing beyond that could be imagined, you might eaſily have obtained it; Nevertheleſſe you have never done any thing for me, but only imployed ſome few ſteps and good words for the procuring of my Proceſſe, which is yet but half effected; Do you think, Sir, that you can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light your ſelf with Women at ſo cheap a rate? Nay which is more, inſtead of gaining any thing from you, I have expended my eſtate upon you, you never came to viſit me, but I made a Collation for you, &amp; if I have been at great char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to cloath my ſelf according unto every faſhion, it hath been only to pleaſe you. This hath put me upon this reſolution to addreſs my ſelf unto you, to intreat you in ſome meaſure to recompenſe my loſſes, being now on my departure to <hi>Tours.</hi> My Husband knoweth what a round ſum of ſilver he did give me, and the moderate expence I ought to be at: What will he ſay when he ſhall find a great deal more laid forth than I had need to have done, and that I am here indebted on all ſides. He will ſuſpect that have ll governed both his mony and my ſelf, and I ſhall live no longer a good hour with him. You for whom I have falſified the faith which I have made unto another, and are the only cauſe that I have ſo ill imployed my money, are not you in Conſcience obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to diſcharge my Creditors? and moreover that I may not put you to any diſgrace or trouble by Arreſts, ought you not to give me ſome honeſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe for having ſo much favoured you, as I have done? If you had trafficked with ordinary Baggages, they would have made you pay, before you had gone from them, for every kiſſe they had given you; Will you complain of that which you ſhall given unto a Woman, who hath devoted her ſelf to none but unto you, and whom you cannot reproach for any Vice of which you are not the cauſe? I will refer my ſelf to theſe Gentlewomen what they ſhall think fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to be done herein, they are ſo wiſe that they will determine nothing but what will be reaſonable.</p>
            <p>This cunning Woman had no ſooner ended her Oration, but ſhe who was the moſt antient of the two Citizens did ſay unto me, The Gentlewoman hath laid open her Caſe with great underſtanding; you ought not to refuſe or deny any thing which ſhe demandeth of you. Remember the pleaſures ſhe hath done you, and if that will not oblige you, let the compaſſion of her ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities prevail upon you, ſhe muſt pay her debts before ſhe can goe out of the City. For ſix months together you have been every day with her, what is it that ſuch a length of time doth not deſerve? Give her only but three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Franks and I believe ſhe will be contented.</p>
            <p>When I obſerved that theſe unworthy women were come ſo boldly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap me, I reſolved to make ſport with them; Nevertheleſſe putting on a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <pb n="21" facs="tcp:59287:81"/>countenance, I ſaid unto them, I confeſſe I am much obliged to Madam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oiſelle, howſoever I might have received many more favours from her than as yet I have, I have not ſeen her theſe three Months, and it is poſſible that ſhe hath got other acquaintance, with whom ſhe hath been as familiar as with my ſelf, but that is nothing, it was not her fault that I did not ſee her oftner, and I am not exempted to recompenſe her for that which ſhe hath done for me, I am ready to content her, if that you pleaſe to cut off ſome part of the great ſum which you demand of me. Sir you ſpeak like a Gentleman ſaid the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt of the Citizens wives, I know ſhe will not tyrannize over you, ſhe will not open her mouth to diſcover unto any what is the recompenſe you will give her. She will be ſatisfied if you beſtow upon her but two thouſand Franks. Two thouſand Franks? (ſaid I) for what think you. Do you think I can get mony as doe the Treaſurers, with the daſh of a Pen? you muſt conſider that I am but a poor Gentleman, who have nothing but a Sword and a Cloak, and if Madamoiſelle will be governed by reaſon, let her moderate the Tax a little. Well then (ſaid the elder Citizens Wife) give her a thouſand Franks, but on my troth ſhe cannot diſcharge you for altogether on the receipt of ſo poor a ſum. Good God (ſaid I) it will utterly ruine me, I will appeal unto her my ſelf. My antient Miſtreſſe ſaid unto me, becauſe you do make your ſell ſo poor, I ſee I muſt content my ſelf with five hundred Livers, but I will have them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, before we give you leave to go out of your Chamber. You have money enough by you to pay a greater Sum.</p>
            <p>When I perceived they would proceed ſo violently with me, I determined to rid my hands of them, and finding they were reſolved to abate nothing of the five hundred Livers, I ſaid unto them, well then, I will pay you preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and calling my Boy unto me, <hi>Biſcayn,</hi> ſaid I, come hither immediatly, and make up your Accounts with me. Tell me your receipt, and your expences. How much money was it that I did give you the other day? You gave me, Sir, a Piſtol, ſaid my Boy, out of which I payed four Quardecues to your Landreſs, I gave eight Souſe to your Lute-maker for half a dozen of ſtrings for your Lute, and I muſt give ten Souſe to the Cobler for ſoling my Shoes, and three Souſe I am to pay to the Woman that ſtarche your Bands. Well Sirrah (ſaid I) what remains? give me a juſt account. The Boy taking the money out of his Pocket, made anſwer to me, Sir, there doth remain a piece of five Souſe, half a Teſton, a piece of Three Blanks, a Carolus, and ſome Doubles. See La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies here, (ſaid I) all the money that I and my Lackey have, It is at your Service with all my heart, if you will content your ſelves with it, otherwiſe I know not what good I can be able to doe unto you. My Gallants ſeeing themſelves ſo mocked, did begin to upbraid me, and call me Beggar, and Paultry Fellow, and all the opprobrious words they could deliver, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on calling them Sluts and Baggages, I was about to riſe from my Bed to drive them down the Stairs, but of themſelves they made all the haſt they could, fearing that worſe would befall them. They returned not ſo peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as they came, for my Boy purſued them with <hi>Clerantes</hi> Lackeys who in their way did aſſault them at every turn, and I never ſince have received the leaſt news of them, but to divert my ſelf I had the choice of many Miſtreſſes, and did make Love on the one ſide, and on the other.</p>
            <p>That which above all things I deſired was the Company of thoſe Women who were ſeen but by few men, for fear I ſhould get the diſeaſe As for Baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy houſes I always hated them, and to ſpeak the truth, it is the brutiſh appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of a Dogg to take his pleaſure with the firſt he meets with, being one whom he never ſaw before, and peradventure whom he ſhall never ſee again. Yet ſometimes I did goe unto them to keep my friends company, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by my ſelf to ſee the faſhion of ſuch places, and to recreate my ſelf with a diverſity of contentments. One Evening not knowing what to do, I did go unto <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59287:82"/>a Bawd, who perpetually demanded of me what I would have, although ſhe had never a Girl in the Houſe: At the laſt ſhe did ſend her Servant to fetch one, who ſhe ſaid was the Pearl of <hi>France.</hi> It was then extremely cold, and yet this good woman had neither Fire nor Candle. She warmed her ſelf in the meditation of the Fire of her firſt Loves. For my ſelf I called for a fire, and gave my Boy money to buy me ſome Billets and a Fagot; In the mean time the Miſtreſſe of the Houſe did entertain me with a thouſand diſcourſes, and the moſt pleaſing ones in the world; She did proteſt unto me, that ſince the beginning of <hi>Lent</hi> ſhe gained but little, or nothing at all; ſhe demanded of me, if I would appoint a day to come unto her, I ſhould ſee one of the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt Citizens Wives of
<hi>Paris;</hi> I made anſwer, with all my heart, and would fain know of her on what day it ſhould be. On my faith (ſaid ſhe) I ſhall have much to do to perform what I have promiſed, but becauſe you appear to be a gallant young Man, I will content you. The Gentlewoman of whom I ſpake hath a Husband who is very jealous of her, and will not permit her to go abroad, but only on Holydays, and <hi>Sundays,</hi> I will acquaint her with it, and God forgive me for my procuring, it is likely that one day when ſhe is to go abroad either to hear Maſſe or Veſpers, ſhe will come hither privatly to give you a meeting I was amaz'd at the diſcours of this Woman, who would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be devout &amp; ſinful at the ſame inſtant, &amp; it left ſuch an impreſſion upon my Soul, that I told her I had no mind to ſee her. I dare aſſure you that as there is nothing which ſooner doth reform the vicious man than the diſtaſt which ſometimes doth poſſeſſe him againſt his own Vice, ſo in ſuch places we ſhall often ſee ſuch ſpectacles that they will even make us to hate thoſe Sins we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to commit, and ſince even in this place I was touched with ſome Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I can hardly be induced to repent that I was there. I would proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in theſe diſcourſes, were it not that I muſt here give a period to this Story, which is none of the worſt. My Lackey being returned with the Wood, I would not have it lighted until ſhe was come who was ſent for, that ſo ſhe might partake of my joy. I attended her coming two hours with great impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. The Miſtreſſe of the Houſe knew not any more what new account to deliver to me to paſſe away the time. At the laſt, ſeeing it was night, I would not ſtay any longer for ſo vain a trifle, and being ſorry for nothing but the loſſe of my money which was laid forth in Wood, I ſaid that the beggarly Baggage who made me ſtay ſo long ſhould not warm her ſelf by my fire when ſhe came, and commanding my Lackey to carry the Wood away, I cauſed him to lay it down at the firſt convenient Corner we did come to, and to give fire to it with a Torch which he had lighted at a Tavern, and there I warmed my ſelf, having none in my Company but my Lackey, and another who ſtood by him.</p>
            <p>This Account I thought requiſite to give unto you; and becauſe that many more ſtories of the ſame Nature are come into my Memory, I will give you a particular Account of them, where you ſhall obſerve the like gallantries which I have put in execution, to enjoy the pleaſure only to boaſt that I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them, and it hath been not always in infamous places, that I have purſued ſuch fancies, for I dare aſſure you, that I have never afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to theſe Academies of Love, for elſewhere we may find occaſions e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to paſſe away our time in vanity and pleaſure.</p>

<hi>FRANCION.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S <hi>Francion</hi> made then a ſtop, The Maſter of the Houſe cauſed Breakfaſt to be brought in; for he would not have him to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his Hiſtory, until he had recovered his ſtrength by the advantage of food, and in the mean time they had the leiſure betwixt themſelves to conſider of the variety of the humours of Men; how ſome of them do only ſtudy to be apparent by their Habits, and others by their affected language, and that the Grandees of the world do oftentimes take more delight to ſpeak unto Fools, than unto Wiſemen, and that thoſe who do ſeem to be moſt modeſt, have often had within their Breaſts the moſt unruly paſſions, and inordinate Loves. We have heard the narration which might inſtruct us to hate Vice; for whatſoever Countenance <hi>Francion</hi> did put upon it, he underſtood well enough that all the pleaſures which he took with
<hi>Lucy</hi> and her Maid were not comparable to a virtuous and a chaſt life. And becauſe he then frequented the Company of Women abandoned to their own pleaſures, he hath ſince confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (as we have been informed) that there is nothing more abominable than ſuch polluted Creatures, and he himſelf hath affirmed, that nothing doth ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sex more odious, than ſometimes to reflect upon them in thoſe infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous places where they are to be found. We will in the ſame manner affirm, that it cannot be impertinent in this place to diſcourſe of their wicked life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will conduce to render them more odious, and that thoſe who follow them thither, may avoid them more than ever <hi>Francion</hi> did. After he had made a ſhort Breakfaſt, he did ſpeak as you ſhall find in this following Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Although the heats of my youth did inforce me to debauchments, as I have repreſented to you, yet even then I entertained thoughts of preferment. I had been to ſee my Mother in <hi>Britany,</hi> where ſhe did give me many excellent inſtructions. I conſidered with my ſelf it was my only courſe to obtain the countenance of one of the Kings Favourites, who would prefer me far better than <hi>Clerantes:</hi> I therefore gained the acquaintance of three or four of his neareſt Kinſmen, and did teſtifie unto them the deſire which I had to do ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to any of the Royal Race. At the beginning (to recompenſe me for the trouble I was at to court them) they promiſed me that undoubtedly I ſhould obtain a certain place that I deſired, which was in the power of <hi>Praxiteles</hi> (you know well enough that he was in great favour with the King) but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59287:83"/>when I did put theſe Signiors in mind of their promiſes, I never found any thing ſo cold as they were; I thought their Souls had been furred over with a Leproſie, and that if they were not continually ſpurred on with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties and demonſtrances they were not capable of any ſenſe at all. I will tell you the truth; Their good fortune, I believe, hath made them half ſtupid, or elſe they counterfeit themſelves to be ſo. If I did diſcourſe to them on one Subject, they would put me upon another, and if they were conſtrained to anſwer me upon any buſineſſe, their anſwer was ſo extravagant, and ſo difficult, that I could not underſtand them.</p>
            <p>I had made a Treatiſe in which I aſſayed to prove, that the Merit of <hi>Praxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teles</hi> was as great as his Proſperity; but they would not permit that it ſhould be Extant; for they ſaid, It came about by a policy of State, fearing it would make the Envy increaſe, which was born unto their Fortune. Who will not judge but that in this they acknowledged their Kinſman was not worthy of the many praiſes that I had given him, and that my Flatteries being too groſſe, they would rather have incited the People to have mock'd, than reſpected him? I have ſince repented my ſelf, that I had done him ſo much honour as to write for him, and I believed, that if Heaven did not favour me in what I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, it was for praiſing ſo unworthy a perſon. The place which I deſired, was given to another, who peradventure never ſued for it, but I will tell you, the Loſſe was as much on their ſide, as one mine; for loſing me, they loſt a Friend, and a Faithfull Servant, who was prepared and reſolved to aſſiſt them in the affaires of greateſt Importance, and they took a Fool to manage the place, who had neither Vnderſtanding nor Fidelity. I beſought <hi>Clerantes</hi> to ſpeak unto them for me, but he would do nothing therein, alleging, that his Authority was of no ſtrength in thoſe affairs, and that there were ſome Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlings at Court, who, ariſing unto Dignities from ſome poor place, did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ake delight to undervalue Signiors of Quality; and moreover, he would not ſo much debaſe himſelf as to ſupplicate to them for any thing. Finding this, I had recourſe to thoſe Conſolations which the Antient Philoſophers do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe unto unto us againſt Adverſities: and although I could not rejoyce in any proſperity, as many others, yet I had this to comfort me in my adverſity, That I was not a ſlave as they were. I obſerved then plainly enough, that to obtain Preferment in the world, there was nothing leſſe profitable than to deſerve it; and I found it remarkable, that (to gain eſteem and reputation in the Court) it were better farre to make profeſſion of Buffonry than of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. I knew not how to diſſemble, nor to make leggs and faces, parts very neceſſary in a Courtier, and if I had known how to have made them, I had not ſo vile a Soul as by ſuch Arts to advance my ſelf: I loved always the acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and flouriſh of
<hi>Wit,</hi> and prompt words, which do teſtifie a good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but not thoſe words which are more fit for a Juggler, or a Corn-cutter, than a Scholar, ſuch as the fooliſh Courtiers do admire; and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, when I would ſpeak any thing agreeable to Senſe, it muſt be either particularly, to content my ſelf, or ſome others who were of my Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Condition, and not to content thoſe who did conceive themſelves to be farre above me.</p>
            <p>Becauſe, therefore, I could not procure their Favour who were the greateſt Men at the Court, I conſorted my ſelf with thoſe who make it their buſineſſe only to laugh, and to make love; in whoſe Company, although there was leſs Profit, yet there was more Contentment: Nevertheleſſe, it was impoſſible for me not to reflect upon my ſelf without much grief, for the loſſe that I made of my Youth, which I ſhould have imployed for the comfort and advantage of thoſe to whom I was obliged to tender all ſervice, and for my own advantage in particular, which was the occaſion, that when ſometimes I was in company, and did deliver my ſelf amongſt them, I immediately became as one that was <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59287:83"/>dumb, and ſuffering my ſelf to be carried away by the violence of the fit, I ſeemed not the ſame Man which I was accuſtomed to be, but as One indued with another Conſtitution, and had changed my Nature with my Mirth. I was extremely afflicted with this Metamorphoſis, and as much as poſſibly I could, I conſtrained my ſelf to the contrary; but becauſe the Cauſe of my Grief could not ſo eaſily be taken away, ſeeing Objects every day that did increaſe my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, I had need in this particular of ſome extraordinary Remedy, or of a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Baniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clerantes,</hi> who underſtood my Diſeaſe, and the Original of it, did with all his power indeavour to comfort me, and did take me along with him to a fair houſe which he had in the Country, and there ſaid unto me, What have you done with your frolick humor? I ſhall take off ſome of the Eſtimation which your merit until now hath obliged me to conceive of it, if you do not indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour your ſelf to be merry. You afflict your ſelf with the diſorder of the world, Take no more thought of it, for it cannot be redreſſed. In deſpight of all men, let us live contrary to them. Let us not follow any of their ſottiſh Cuſtomes; For my ſelf, I will for ever abandon the Court, where I never received the leaſt Content. If here in the Country we will paſſe away our time in the Delights of Love, we ſhall find luſty young Beauties, and farre ſurpaſſing thoſe of the Court, who are covered over with Painting, proceeding from a thouſand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, to make plump their lank and exhauſted fleſh. I remember I have lain with ſome of them ſo lean, that I had rather almoſt be put upon the Rack. When I was laſt with <hi>Lucy,</hi> I perceived that her Beauty proceeded more from Art than Nature. Her body was compoſed of nothing but Skin, and Bones.</p>
            <p>The free Humor of this Lord did pleaſe me, and I readily conſented to him in whatſoever he deſired. He had abandoned his Greatneſſe at the Court, without retaining ſo much as the Memory of it, and ſtooped ſo low, that on Sundays he would dance under the Elms with the old Blades of the Pariſh, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Lucrin.</hi> He would play at Bowls with them for a Supper, and took delight to ſee them drink deep, and to hear them relate the Wonders of their Times. When he was in the moſt ſerious humor, he would ſend for the Antiquity of his Tenants, and would intreat them to give an account unto him of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they did remember was done in the dayes of their Youth. O what a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light did he receive to hear them diſcourſe of the affairs of State, of which they expreſſed themſelves according to their own opinions, and the opinion of their Grand-fathers, laying alwayes all the blame on thoſe Lords who were moſt near unto the perſon of the King. For my ſelf, of my own Nature I did nothing approve the communication of ſuch ignorant and miſguided Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; nevertheleſſe to be reſponſible to him, I did ſo inforce my ſelf to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that I might ſafely aſſure him I did take ſome pleaſure, when it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to ſee him merry, becauſe my principal deſign was to enjoy the honour of his Company in ſome pleaſant condition of life.</p>
            <p>In this manner I did deport my ſelf, until a gallant deſign did invade me which few other men would undertake; It was told me, that about three miles from thence there lived in a Farm one of the moſt handſome Women in the World. I reſolved to put my ſelf into the habit of a Peaſant, and to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with me Viol, on which I could play with dexterity enough, that by that means I might be admitted the more near unto her company. That which did beget this reſolution in me, was, that I underſtood this delicate Creature did love to laugh very heartily, and to entertain her friends with the moſt pleaſant diſcourſes, I hoped therefore to give her ſuch facetious language, that it ſhould be the greateſt of pleaſures to hear our Salutations. And it fell out ſo happily, that on that day in which I was reſolved to goe, there was a wedding in the Village; <hi>Clerantes</hi> having a mind to ramble with me, did furniſh himſelf <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59287:84"/>with a Cymbal to accompany me, becauſe it is an Inſtrument which is not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to play upon, for you muſt only ſtrike upon the ſtrings within it with a wire on the cadence of every Song.</p>
            <p>In the morning we departed out of the Houſe with our accuſtomed habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, cauſing it to be noiſed abroad, that we were to travail twelve leagues; we took not any one with us but the Groom only of my Chamber, a cloſe and a cunning Wagg. Being about four miles from
<hi>Clerantes</hi> houſe, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a thick wood, where we did cloath our ſelves with raggs; <hi>Clerantes</hi> did cover his face half over with a napkin, and made his beard black, which was naturally of a flaxen colour, becauſe he would not be known by any: As for my ſelf, I only did put a playſter on one of my eyes, and did put an old hat on my head, the brims whereof I could at my pleaſure either lift up or pull down, becauſe it was cloven in the middle, as if it were the Umbrier of ſome Troopers old Head-piece.</p>
            <p>In this Equipage we marched to the Village where the Nuptials were to be ſolemnized. My Groom had ſet our Horſes into a Stable, and attended at the Inn until ſuch time as we ſhould have need of his ſervice; We did ſteer the direct way to the Father of the young Maid who was to be married, whom we found to be a good honeſt Country Fellow: I demanded of him, if he had not need of my ſervice, he told me, that he had already entertained a Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrell, and given him ſix ſouſe in earneſt, and promiſed him a Crown more for his pains; I replyed, I demand of you but only one half Crown, both for me and my Companion; We can alſo doe you good ſervice in the Kitchin, in which we are moſt ſufficient to diſcharge our ſelves, having been both of us under Cooks in one of the moſt hoſpitable Kitchins of <hi>France.</hi> The Country man finding us to be more uſefull and cheaper than any other, following the advice of his Wife, who would not be at more charge than needs ſhe muſt, did entertain us. The other Fiddler came immediatly afterwards, ſo there was no little diſpute betwixt him and me; he alleged that he had contracted with him two days before, and that he came two miles on purpoſe to ſerve at the Wedding. I affirmed that I had notice of it as well as himſelf, and came eight miles, being hired by a certain man who fifteen days agoe did give me earneſt as he paſſed that way, and injoyned me not to fail to be at the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. My cauſe was found, by all who were preſent, to be better than his, wherefore, having kept his earneſt, he did go away diſcomforted.</p>
            <p>We did ſet our ſelves to work in the Kitchin, and
<hi>Clerantes</hi> who would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes enquire of his people how his meat was dreſſed, and be preſent with them in the Kitchin, had made very good ſawce, if he had been allowed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials wherewith to do it. We did content our ſelves to make all things rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy after the groſſeſt manner, according to the Counſell of our Superviſers, who ever and anon would come to ſee us. Every one being returned from Maſſe, the Table was covered, and they did ſit down to dinner. The Citizens Wife did ſit down firſt of all, for it was the Daughter of the Keeper of her Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards that was married; I had the opportunity to gaze a long time upon them all, and muſt confeſſe, that I have ſeldom ſeen more handſome Women. Dinner being ended, the Bridegroom and his Bride did ſit down at the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of a Table, on which was placed a great Brazen Baſin, and at every gift which was brought unto them for an Offering, they ſtooped down their heads, and made a great reverence in the way of thankfulneſſe. Thoſe who gave two pieces of ſilver were ſo covetous of glory, that the better to be heard, they did let them fall down into the Baſin one after the other; The Citizens Wife did make them a preſent of two ſilver Forks, another woman of the Pariſh did give them an Iron Fork to take Fleſh out of the Pot, and at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end thereof there was a little Ladle; ſome gave them Pincers, and ſome Hammers, which at the fartheſt end were made to open, and a little to divide
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59287:84"/>the head the better to book out nails, In whatſoever was given I did obſerve ſome figure of the Fork, which was a bad preſage for poor <hi>ſobelin.</hi> After the offring was ended, he ſtayed with his Wife at the I ables end almoſt hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> an hour, to ſee if any more pieces of ſilver would drop into the Baſin, after which time they retired themſelves, and counted what they had laid forth, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving they were at great loſſe in their Wedding Dinner they did both fall a weeping ſo abundantly, that I who was next unto them, was conſtrained to comfort them. The Father of the Bride did then come unto them, no told them that the Lord of the Town had conſented to him, that ad the Company ſhould come thither and dance in his Caſtle, and that they themſelves were to goe formoſt with the Violl. I made ready my Inſtrument, and playing the firſt fancy that came into my mind, I was the Conductor of all the Troop. The ſound of the Cimball did not pleaſe any of them, <hi>Clerantes</hi> therefore was conſtrained to leave off his unprofitable muſick; and going directly before me he had the garb and every poſture of a Iuggler ſo directly, that had I not known him, I ſhould have taken him for the greateſt Hocus Pocus in the world. Being in the Court of the Caſtle, I played the Canaries, which almoſt all the company danced; After that I played Galliards and Currantoes, which the Clowns did dance in ſuch a manner that I received great pleaſure by it, which hindred me from entertaining any grief to ſee my ſelf ſo prodigiouſly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſed. On the other ſide I was infinitely taken with the diſcourſe of ſome old women, who late next unto me.

<hi>Rabina?</hi> you look melancholy on it, I am afraid you are not well. You are pleaſed to ſay ſo, ſaid the Servant. Ha <hi>Rabina,</hi> have you ſeen the Bride? ſaid the Villager, And will not you be taken as well as others? There hath been a hard Froſt this Winter, Well, God mend all.

It may ſuffice that I ſaw a new Art of Love practiced, quite contrary to that which gentle <hi>Ovid</hi> did deſcribe.</p>
            <p>All this while <hi>Clerantes</hi> with a heedfull eye did obſerve whatſoever was done, and a great many of the Gentry of that Country arriving, he minded the Wedding no more, but did goe into the Hall where the Citizens Wife was gone before him. The Signior of the Caſtle obſerving how he had bound up his head, did ſay unto him. How now honeſt fellow, who was it that hath broke open the Coffer of your Underſtanding? It is one who will not cure it, (ſaid <hi>Clerantes</hi>) counterſeiting with his voice as much as poſſibly he could, I have ſo wicked a Woman to my Wife ſaid he, that I believe ſhe hath in her Body a little Devil. Oh Gentlemen, my heart is ready to break, ſo great is the anguiſh ſhe doth put me to. God is my witneſſe how often I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make her virtuous, by beating her back, and thumping her belly, but I could never do any good on her, although I have heard that thoſe of her Sex, are of the diſpoſition of Aſſes, and Nut-trees, from which no profit can be had, unleſſe they are often and ſoundly beaten. I am a Cooper by my Profeſſion, and do not play on the Cymball but only upon Holydays. The other day being not able to make her deſiſt from abuſing me, with the help of my Servant, I did put her into one of the largeſt Tubs, and afterwards clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up the Tub with the Head-pieces of it, ſo that ſhe had no air at all, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the Bung hole. I took my Pully, and let the Veſſel fall down into my Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and by and by I would pluck it up again with all the ſtrength I had, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly I would let it fall down again into the Cellar, and in this hot exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe I continued as long as poſſibly I could, and ſhe within was ſo tormented, that I thought ſhe had repented her ſelf that ſhe ever had offended me, but clean contrary to what I propounded to my ſelf, ſhe putting forth her mouth as well as ſhe could out of the little window of her lodging, did call me a thouſand Rogues, and ſpoke many other reproachfull words not to be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. In the end I was conſtrained to let her alone to paſſe away her choler by her ſelf. In the Evening a curſed deſire did poſſeſſe me to take of her my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary pleaſure, to which I am ſo accuſtomed that I cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it ſo much as one night, unleſſe I ſhould ſuffer ſo much torture as if I were burning at ſome fire. Nevertheleſſe I reſolved with my ſelf not to take her out of the Tub, fearing otherwiſe that ſhe would have committed ſome outrage upon me, as oftentimes ſhe had done before on a far leſſe occaſion. Sweet-heart, ſaid I, Kiſſe me here at the Bunghole, and afterwards we will live in peace. No, No, ſaid ſhe, I had rather have in Hell the friendſhip of the Devil, than thine. Upon my faith, ſaid I unto her, I will do ſo no more,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59287:86"/>that is to ſay I will beat thee no more, but will alwayes endeavour to pleaſe thee, and be always doing the beſt I can, Therefore before thou comeſt forth give me ſix kiſſes, and that being done I promiſe that I will relieve thee from thy Priſon. That offer overcame her obſtinacy, and ſhe accorded to what I did deſire, and bringing her mouth as near as poſſibly ſhe could to the Bunghole, I did put forth my lips as far as ever I could to reach her mouth, but do what I could I could not come at it. In the end I was enforced to take her from the place where ſhe was, ſo much my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire did tranſport me. After we had ſufficiently ſported our ſelves, ſhe began again to quarrel with me, and to tell me that ſhe knew well enough that I had been playing the knave with a young Woman that was her neighbour, I know not how ſhe came to underſtand it, for I was ſo valiant at that time, that I did her as good ſervice as ever in my life, but neither good words nor good deeds would ſerve her turn, for ſhe was angry beyond all meaſure. The Sun riſing did ſee our contention, and was witneſſe that ſhe threw a charged Piſſepot at my head, with the edge whereof ſhe hurt me as you ſee, and I dare aſſure you (as far as I can perceive) that I deſerved no blame at all.</p>
            <p>This Story of <hi>Clerantes</hi> did make all the Company to laugh outright, but eſpecially the Citizens Wife, who propounded many petulant queſtions to him. One of the Gentlemen of the Company did command him to ſing him a Song. Immediatly he played upon the Cymball, and did ſing one of the beſt Songs he had. Being invited to ſing more, and having no more to ſing, he told them that they muſt call me, for I had all the variety of the braveſt Songs in the world, The wedding ſtayed without a Violl or any other Muſick to content the Lord of the Caſtle, to whom with all ſpeed I addreſſed my ſelf. My voice accorded with my Inſtrument, &amp; I did ſing all the modeſt Songs that were ever made by others, or which I had compoſed my ſelf in the height of my debauchment, when I had the Glaſſe in my hand; I made ſuch faces, and uſed ſuch ſtrange poſtures when I was ſinging them, that all the Buffons of <hi>Europe</hi> would be glad of my picture (as then I did deport my ſelf) to gain a livelyhood thereby.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Clerantes</hi> did draw near unto two old men who did not addict their minds to liſten to my Muſick. They ſeriouſly diſcourſed on a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which touched his particular, not as he was now in the quality of a Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrell, but as he was the Lord <hi>Clerantes.</hi> He diſſembled not to hear them, that they might ſtill continue to ſpeak aloud, and would no ſo much as look towards them, becauſe he would not poſſeſſe them with a ſuſpition that he did give ear to their communication, and they conceiving him to be ſome idle ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fellow did not Judge him to have a capacity to comprehend their reaſons, wherefore one of them proceeded in his diſcourſe, <hi>Clerantes</hi> (ſaid he) hath been ſome days in this Country, as I am informed, but this morning he is gone away from us, and I am very glad of it, for I had rather hear that he was in
<hi>Turky</hi> than in this place, I always hated him ſince I knew him. He is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vicious, and addicted to Wine and Woman, and doth many things which doe greatly derogate from his quality. I do eſteem my Son who is but a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer better, who is an honeſt and a loyal Peaſant (as Heaven in his birth hath ordained him) than I like <hi>Clerantes</hi> who doth not live like a great Lord, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by his Fortune and his birth he is one. He will not diſpleaſe you long replyed the other, I tell you as a friend, and deſire you to keep it ſecret, there are ſome people who at this preſent are of great power in the State, who are determined to make away with him without any more a doe or noiſe, now he is abſent from the Court. They have ſent a man hither to put the deſign in execution, who although he hath miſſed of him this morning, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure find the means throughly to perform it, if he ſhall find him on the way as he returneth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59287:87"/>Although he did ſpeak theſe laſt words lower than the reſt, yet <hi>Clerantes</hi> did underſtand them well enough, and to drive away the grief that did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade him, on the knowledge of this ſo wicked an enterpriſe to take away his life, he did goe to one of the Servants, and deſired him to give him ſome wine, for he had made himſelf ſo dry with ſinging, that he was but a dead man if he had not ſomething given him to ſatisfie his thirſt. Wherefore they did give him as much as he would drink, &amp; he retiring himſelf to a Corner, did take out of a Wallet which he had, ſome of the relicks of the wedding, and I greedily ſnatched from him many good morſels of it.</p>
            <p>Going to eat it at the Window, I ſaw in the Court one of the moſt pleaſant things to me in the World. Dreſſing the pottage, and the yellow Rice for Dinner, I had put into the pot a certain laxative compoſition which I had brought with me. This Drug making at this time its operation, all thoſe who were at the wedding dinner were conſtrained to goe as faſt as they could to diſcharge themſelves of a burthen, which being thin, and weighing not very heavy, was therefore the more difficult to bear. There were ſome who did go into the ſtables, and made uſe of ſtraw to terge their poſteriors, others had not leiſure to goe ſo far, and did empty their bellies on the Dunghill, or any other convenient place they could find. In my abſence young men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did dance to tunes only that were ſung. The greateſt part of the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were gone away in obedience to the naſty Tyrant that commanded them, and the poor Bride who ſuffered more violent pangs in her belly than any of the reſt, becauſe ſhe had eaten more of the Rice, was inforc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to an uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led neceſſity. She believed that it was unbeſeeming her who made the Feaſt to forſake thoſe who in the dance did hold her by the hand, there did therefore a certain liquor run down from her to the ground, the evil ſmell whereof did aſcend into the Noſes of all who danced, and in the dance having often trod upon it, it cauſed them to look down upon the ground, whereupon a great diſpute did ariſe on that intricate buſineſſe, to underſtand which of them it was, who at ſo ſolemn a meeting, and in the Company of the Bride, had ſo diſgraced themſelves. The Men did all withdraw from the Women, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leging that their Breeches were large enough to contain their Excrements for a whole Fortnight, without being conſtrained to throw it on the ground amongſt ſo many honeſt perſons. But every one feeling the ſame malady, and being aſhamed to leave their ordures behind them in the Signiors Caſtle, (whom I had called to the Window with all the Company to behold that pleaſant adventure) all thoſe who came in with the Wedding returned to their own houſes one after another, not without much laughter of thoſe who did behold them to dance other Currantoes than thoſe which I played with my Rebeck. Every on did paſſe his judgement on it, and almoſt all of them concluded that the occaſion of this ſo univerſal a looſeneſs was that they were not any of them accuſtomed to ſeed on ſo much Rice before.</p>
            <p>The Citizens wife herſelf was not exempted from this malady, which did take her on the ſudden, as ſhe was mocking thoſe whom ſhe ſaw ſo much tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fearing to commit the like fault ſhe did go out of the Hall, and not knowing where to diſcharge her burthen, ſhe travailed from one ſide of the Baſe Court to the other. At the laſt ſhe did meet with a Lackey, of whom (as if ſhe was half beſides herſelf) ſhe demanded where were the Privies, he pointed to them with his Finger, but as ſhe plucked up her cloathes to ſit down. a young wench who had as great need as her ſelf, would place her ſelf in the ſeat before her. They were in conteſtation who ſhould ſit down firſt, In the mean time the Mother of the Bride, who was a big Country wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man did come in, and by her age did claim precedency, ſo that thoſe two were conſtrained to let all run from them as they ſtood.</p>
            <p>The Citizens Wife being returned, was conſtrained not long afterwards by <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59287:87"/>a ſecond neceſſity as great as the former to return to the ſame place, where ſhe did her buſineſſe with more eaſe than at the firſt, which when I beheld, I ſaid unto the Gentlemen, that I conceived their company was not agreeable to her, becauſe ſhe did nothing elſe but withdraw herſelf from them, and did retire into ſome other place. She perceiving that I made ſport with her, did indeavour to requite the curteſie, and to apprehend the ſubtilty of my Spirit, She laid unto me, Tell me honeſt Minſtrel which of all thy ſtrings is the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt to tune? Is it not the Treble? I replyed, No indeed forſooth, It is that which is the biggeſt and moſt nervous of all, I am ſometime two hours before I can wind it up to its full hight, nevertheleſſe I aſſure my ſelf if you will but touch it with your finger, it will be in tune immediatly, as it ought to be; when you pleaſe you ſhall ſee the experience of it, for it will make ſuch a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that it will raviſh and entrance your Spirit. The laughter which hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was raiſed did more and more invite the Citizens Wife to make uſe of ſome invention to be revenged of him, but <hi>Clerantes</hi> riſing from his place, rouling his eyes in his head, &amp; holding a glaſs of wine in his hand, did begin to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit a Drunkard, and ſo to the life, that I ſhould have believed he had been drunk in good earneſt, did not I know how well he could carry wine, and that he had not drunk half ſo much as he muſt have done to have an intoxicated brain. He ſtaggerd at every ſtep, and ſtammerd with his tongue, and began to rave like a Mad-man. To have a taſt of the wine he did put his little Finger in the Glaſſe, and inſtead therof he ſucked his Thumb; when he drank he ſpilt half of the wine upon himſelf and pulled his ſhirt out of his Codpiece to wipe his mouth, and ſpreading his thighs he ſhewed to the Citizens wife all that he had; But ſhe the better to play the Hippocrite, cryed out, and covered her eyes with her hand, and cunningly opened her Fingers, that unperceived ſhe might behold him. <hi>Clerantes</hi> continuing his extravagancies, and ſeeing her in the middle Hall, did approach unto her to make water, as if ſhe had been ſome Statue, or a Wall. Holding his hand in his Breeches, he ſtooped his head to lean it upon her, and ſhe drew back from him. I was adviſed at laſt to have him to bed, and I ſo prevailed that I conducted him to the Houſe of the Citizens Wife which was next to the Caſtle, wbere thoſe who were new married were to lye that night. When ſhe her ſelf came home, ſhe cauſed him to be lodged in a little Chamber hard by the Gate, and demanded of me if I thought that ſuddenly he would return to his ſenſe again; ſhe did ſpeak to me of this in ſuch a manner, that it gave me to underſtand ſhe was nothing glad to ſee him in that exceſſe of Wine, and that ſhe did like his company when he was frolick and in a good humour. I made anſwer to her that in an hours reſpite it would not appear that he had drank at all. She had ſeen the moſt deſired part of his Body in the Hall, and having entred into the Room where he lay, ſhe had now ſeen it again, and ſhe ceaſed not to expreſſe unto me what a handſome Man he was, and of a good countenance, which ſhe plainly obſerved, although he had his face half covered with a Napkin. Theſe words did ſuggeſt unto me that ſhe did bear him a great deal of good will, which I acquainted <hi>Clerantes</hi> with, who was glad to underſtand it: And in truth I was nothing deceived, for ſhe was poſſeſſed with ſuch violent tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that after all the Houſe were diſpatched to their beds, and ſhe had lodged me in a Chamber a great way from him, ſhe came privately without a Candle into the Chamber where <hi>Clerantes</hi> was, and did lye in the ſame bed with him, conceiving that moſt privately ſhe ſhould injoy her pleaſure with him, becauſe he himſelf could not diſcover without light who it was that was his Bedfellow, and having at that time his underſtanding oppreſſed with the vapour of the Wine, he in the morning might poſſibly believe that all was but a dream that had happened to him.</p>
            <p>She had no ſooner touched him, but he knew well enough who it was, and <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59287:88"/>without ſpeaking any word did indeavour to ſatisfie her with thoſe pleaſures, after which her heart ſo panted. At eleven of the Clock at night, one knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Gate, ſhe immediatly did riſe, and demanded who it was that would come in. He made anſwer, it was her Husband, and deſired her to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Door immediatly, becauſe he was very weary, being come all upon the Gallop from his houſe in the Country. She made anſwer, Good God, there is a Gentleman but juſt now gone from hence, who hath been every where to look you out, I ſatisfied him that you were gone to your other houſe in the Country, he hath buſineſſe of great importance with you, did you not meet him on the way? No, ſaid her Husband, for I came by the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and incloſures: Go back I pray you then, ſaid ſhe, and keep the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and you undoubtedly will meet him.</p>
            <p>Her Husband being much troubled to conceive what the buſineſſe ſhould be that carried ſuch a conſequence in the Forehead of it, did put ſpur unto his Horſe, and rode back unto the Village. His Wife being glad that her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention took ſuch effect, did return to
<hi>Clerantes,</hi> with whom ſhe ſtayed as long as poſſibly ſhe could, but the day appearing her husband did arrive, who aſſured her that he could hear no news of the Gentleman who asked for him, although he enquired of every one on the way, &amp; in the ſtreets of the Village, where to his great trouble, he continued in the queſt of him all the beſt part of the night.</p>
            <p>Having taken our leave of the Citizens Wiſe we departed cheerfull and frolick, and arrived at the Inn where the Groom of my Chamber did attend us. Having perceived us, he immediatly did lead forth our Horſes, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us at a diſtance. We called back into our memories all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular paſſages of the day before, and <hi>Clerantes</hi> declared to me what he had underſtood of the two old men, which made me to conjecture that it was his good Genius who had took upon him that diſguiſe to diſcover ſo great a treachery. I very much rejoyced at it, and at his good fortune to enjoy that beauty, for which I would have gone a hundred miles on my bare feet, and transformed my ſelf into any ſhape, if it had been neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Let thoſe (who will impute this voyage of <hi>Clerantes</hi> to a madneſſe in him) conſider; that he could not make love to a Citizens wife in his ordinary habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments, becauſe thereby he ſhould have left a blemiſh on his reputation, It were far better for him to do as he did; He made uſe of a cunning invention in reherſing the counterfeit Hiſtory of his Wife, for you muſt know when he ſaid that from the arms of his neighbours wife he returned as luſty as ever, and in a gallant poſture to imbrace his own, he made the Citizens Wifes mouth to water, and adminiſtred new fuell to her deſires; In this, as in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things he carried himſelf moſt diſcreetly.</p>
            <p>Moreover there was nothing that could have conveyed ſo much pleaſure to him, as his being thus diſguiſed; firſt, becauſe he could not otherwiſe ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, unleſſe with great difficulties, have ſeen the vulgar errors; and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe he took a provident delight for a ſhort time to change the courſe of his life, and to obſerve how he ſhould have been uſed if he had been a play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on the Cymball or the Viol. When great perſonages are pleaſed to act a part in ſome Comedy, they always chooſe to repreſent thoſe perſons who are of the loweſt conditions. They receive great content, at leaſt in imagination, to make tryal of a condition of life ſo far removed from their own. What will it advantage us ſo to bind up our ſelves to the Majeſty of great eſtates, as never to aſſume the liberty to deſcend a little to obſerve the inferiour imployments of the World? Fortune oftentimes doth inforce Prince, whether they will or no, from the royal Pomp which did inviron them, and doth throw them into the extremeſt poverty, and to have their habitations in Cabans of turf. There is nothing loſt to be ſometimes in the ſociety of a ragged Companion. <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59287:88"/>Let the vulgar ſpeak what they pleaſe, it was a gallantry in <hi>Nero,</hi> to imploy himſelf to play on the Cittern, that he might earn his bread, if at any time he ſhould be diſpoſſeſſed of his Throne. On the other ſide, it is no ill Leſſon for great Signiors to underſtand how poor men are inforced to live, for it makes them to take compaſſion on them, and this compaſſion doth teſtifie an huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in them, which doth render them more commendable.</p>
            <p>It is true, that amongſt theſe things (which might all of them have been done with a good intention, and without any mixture of impurity) this Lord did let looſe the bridle to Intemperance; but there is no man ſo perfect who hath not his defects. Let us ſtudy and practiſe the beſt, and abandon the worſt. We may call to mind that <hi>Clerantes</hi> did many things in this diſguiſe, which might prove much to his advantage.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations, and ſuch as theſe are, did entertain us in the way, and when we came to the Wood, where the day before we did put on our ragged habiliments, we did there put them off, and did attire our ſelves in our own cloaths, which the Groom of my Chamber did bring unto us.
<hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes</hi> being come home, did acquaint a Counſellor (who was a friend of his) that he heard from an old Gentleman of the Country, that there was a man who haunted his Caſtle, who had entertained a reſolution to kill him. The Counſellor immediatly addreſſed himſelf to the old Man whom he named, and aſſured him that of neceſſity he muſt tell him whatſoever he knew concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that affair, and that already he had been heard to ſpeak of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could pretend no Ignorance. All that he could draw from him, was, that whatſoever he had ſpoken was grounded upon common report. He was examined again as ſtrictly as may be, and at the laſt he did learn of him the place where it was likely this fellow might be found, who had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to commit this murther. Moreover he deſcribed his Complexion, Age, Stature and the Colour of his Cloathes. Some were ſent to find him out, and apprehend him, but in vain, for not finding the opportunity to put his bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy deſign, he was gone away full of Deſpair.</p>
            <p>The Counſellor adviſed <hi>Clerantes</hi> to be revenged of the old man, who was ſo wicked as not to come unto him, to diſcover the enterpriſe that was contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt him; but he would do nothing in it, and doubted that both he and his Companion, who did bear ſo mortal a hatred to him, had received ſome injury on his behalf, in which he was nothing deceived; for as he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by his Secretary, the Receivers under his authority had deceived them, of a certain ſum of money that was due unto them, of which they were infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſenſible, becauſe they were extremly poor; wherefore from his own Coffers he cauſed the ſaid ſum of money to be taken, and did ſend it to them, deſiring them for the time to come to be his friends. This courteſie did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely gain their good wills, as ſince they have made apparent by their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and affection to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clerantes</hi> thus delivered from that danger, did determine to renew his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with fair <hi>Amye;</hi> This was the name of the Citizens wife, whom once more he deſired to have in his Armes. Love exercizing on him a violent authority, he was conſtrained to obey it, he reſolved therefore to give a viſit to his Sweet-heart, in whatſoever manner it was. He thought it incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to diſguiſe himſelf as before, nevertheleſſe we did go forth with a very inconſiderable train, who moſt of them carrying Hawks on their fiſts, they did let fly, as we directed, and perceived the Game, and we came to the very houſe where
<hi>Clerantes</hi> chief delight was lodged. He commanded one of his Servants to alight, and knock at the Garden door, to acquaint them that one of his Hawks was fled into the Garden, which he deſired to have. They no ſooner heard of
<hi>Clerantes</hi> name, but courteouſly they did open the door, aſſuring him that it was more than they knew of any hawk that fled that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59287:89"/>way; The Faulconer nevertheleſs never ceaſed hallowing and luring the Hawk. At the laſt <hi>Clerantes</hi> and my ſelf alighted, and entring into the Garden where the Faulconer was, we demanded if they had not taken up a Hawk which we had loſt. The Citizens wife ſeeing the Lord
<hi>Clerantes,</hi> did courteouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe her ſelf unto him, and intreated him that he would be pleaſed to reſt himſelf a little in her houſe, until his Servants had found the Hawk.</p>
            <p>To make uſe of the occaſion which ſo fairly offered it ſelf, <hi>Clerantes</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he would not refuſe her civility, becauſe he was very weary. Our voices differed much from thoſe which we had counterfeited at the Wedding, neither were our Countenances to be known, for when we had diſguiſed our ſelves to perſonate two Minſtrels, ſhe took us not to be thoſe men whom now ſhe beheld, ſo much her judgement had deceived her eyes, and indeed, who could be ſo cunning, as to diſcern the truth of ſuch a myſtery? We being ſate, and ſhe likewiſe, <hi>Clerantes</hi> ſaid, that the humour of his Faulcon which had ſtrayed away was extremly unpleaſing to him, it being the moſt uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and the moſt unfaithfull Bird that ever he found; I made anſwer that if ſhe was fled quite away, it was no great loſſe, becauſe there were better e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day to be found. In this manner we did maintain a long diſcourſe upon Falconry, not without ſome reflections upon Ladies, which gave the Citizens wife to underſand that we were good fellowes. She returned us but very ſparing anſwers, although we did provoke her to ſpeak as much as we could. Madam, ſaid <hi>Clerantes,</hi> to give you without diſſembling an account of my coming hither, it was rather to ſee you, than to have my Faulcon again. She made anſwer, that he muſt pardon her, if ſhe could not believe that he would take ſo much pains for to ſee ſo unworthy a creature as her ſelf. Do you think then (he replyed) that I do eſteem more of my Falcon than of you? you do ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly abuſe your ſelf, for I have more reaſon to make much of you than of it; for it is credible you will not be ſo unkind, as to diſappoint your Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coner of the pleaſure of that Game which always you keep about you. I interrupted him, and ſaid, Sir, There is a remarkable difference between Falcons and Ladies, which peradventure you do not obſerve. What is that? ſaid <hi>Clerantes:</hi> It is, ſaid I, that Faulcons ſtooping with great violence do ſeize upon the prey, and Ladies only do attend it; <hi>Amye</hi> finding her ſelf to be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the quick, did, to defend her ſelf, allege, that the reputation of her Sex could not be ſo highly eſteemed as it did deſerve, and that which hindred that they could not give ſuch remarkable demonſtrations of their worth, was the weakneſſe of their Enemies, whoſe virtues it was no great glory to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount. And what appearance have you for it Madam, ſaid I, Have you all inchanted Armor, ſuch as <hi>Viganda</hi> gave to the Knights Errants whom ſhe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured? We have no Arms at all but ſuch as you can bend and make plyant at your pleaſure, and whenſoever we aſſault you, we do not offend you, but are ſure to loſe our own ſtrength. Theſe, ſaid
<hi>Amye,</hi> are the ordinary excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the vanquiſhed, who are always of a belief that the Conquerors doe practiſe ſome deceit to obtain the Conqueſt, By ſuch Arts you think to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal your Cowardiſe, but you take unprofitable pains. Alas poor Warriers, what would you do if we ſhould uſe armes offenſive as well as defenſive, with the laſt of which we do only content our ſelves, to abate the hight and ſtiffneſs of your Pride? Peradventure, ſaid <hi>Clerantes,</hi> that we ſhould then be always Conquerors; for endeavouring to offend us on the one ſide, you would take no care to defend your ſelves on the other, ſo that you would never gain the battell: The affairs then ſtanding in this condition, we our ſelves may have the Victory, if we will deſire it; for the preſumption you do nouriſh that you can tame your mutinous Enemy when you pleaſe, doth cry up your power more than any generous courage that you have. At this inſtant we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the proof thereof, in that you are ſo obſtinate, as with your Tongue to <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59287:89"/>hold combat with two Champions at once, who eaſily can ſurmount you in the Juſtice of their Cauſe, although you add more colour to your eloquence than they. For my ſelf, I love not to fight with words, I had rather ſtrike home with good Arms, and demonſtrate my valour by effects. If you pleaſe, I will throw down my Glove, according to the antient cuſtom of Chivalry, to give you an aſſurance that I will come on ſuch a day as you ſhall appoint, to make proof of my valour againſt yours: I will make choice of <hi>Francion</hi> to be Iudge of the Field. Knight errant of Love, ſaid <hi>Amye,</hi> you ſhew your ſelf to be but a novice, and unworthy of your profeſſion, becauſe you obſerve not the true rules of Knighthood, you ought to be chaſtiſed by your King who hath dubb'd you knight! Have you not learn'd that there ought not any one to be Judge in the combats you deſire to fight, which are to be managed in private. On theſe words, I interrupted her and ſaid, You are infinitely reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Fight with one another as long as you pleaſe, I will not interpoſe to be your Judge in the Conflict. The hour is propitious to you both to joyn in battail; Farewell for a while, I will go ſee if your Hawk be yet heard of again. Begin when you ſhall think good your ſelves, and the Devil take him that ſhall part you.</p>
            <p>Speaking thoſe words, in a garb of fleering humility, I did reverence to them, and ſhutting the door after me, I returned to
<hi>Clerantes</hi> Servants, with whom I diſcourſed of Falconry, and of a covey of Partridges which the Spaniels had newly ſprung: In the mean time
<hi>Clerantes</hi> following the good counſell which I had given him, did imploy himſelf to combat with his fair Warrier, and demanded of her, if ſhe were in the reſolution that the prize ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly begin to be playd. She who had maintained the former diſcourſe but only in a gallantry, was ſurprized in amazement to ſee that ſhe ſhould be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted in good earneſt; No, no, ſaid ſhe, I will not have the honour to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come you at this preſent, you have not had time enough to arm and provide you ſelf. You ſhall pardon me, anſwered <hi>Clerantes,</hi> I would not have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Combat if I had not found my ſelf provided for it.</p>
            <p>On thoſe words he did lead her into the next Chamber, and prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to give her a reſtimony of his valour, but ſhe told him that if he touched her ſhe would cry out, and would call to her Husband, He made anſwer, Why, Madam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do you not remember but that even now you ſaid, That there ought not any to be judge in our Combat? ſhe replyed, I thought not of the evil which you had then in your heart. Let us talk no more of that, ſaid <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes,</hi> conſider with your ſelf that they that ſhall come in hither, and find me ſhut up with you, will believe that by a remarkable cunning, you doe cry out after the buſineſſe is done, only to grow upon their good opinion to have them think well of it, when there is no occoſion for it, and by that means you will be the more defamed, and accuſed of Hypocriſie, and you will receive thereby much ſhame and ſorrow, without taſting any pleaſure at all. As for the reſt of your allegation, I am confident that your Husband is not within, and ſo I was informed when I came into your Houſe. Wo is me, ſaid ſhe, you are too ſubtle for me, I thought to have ſpoken in mirth only to paſſe away the time, and you turn it into treaſon againſt me. Well, well, ſaid
<hi>Clerantes,</hi> the Ordinances which you lately mentioned are of no value, for I find it moſt neceſſary to have a Iudge in whatſoever Combat it be, for if I have one, he ſhall be an eye witneſſe that I will uſe no treachery in this Combat, nor will ſhew any foul play in it, No, no, Sweetheart, he ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſaid, and did put his hand upon her Breaſts, It is no treaſon to aſſault you before, and to begin here. For all theſe words ſhe did continue to make reſiſtance, which did inforce him to demonſtrate that ſhe did him wrong to refuſe that to him, which but a few days before ſhe had vouchſafed to a play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on the Cymball; You cannot deny it, ſaid he, it was a good Angel who told <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59287:90"/>me the tydings of it. He alſo informed me that the reaſon which moſt induced you to it, was becauſe you conceived the affair ſhould be carried ſo extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecret, you were then pleaſed to admit him, and without doubt did think it not ill done, becauſe it was ſo well managed by you, that even he who was the party did not know himſelf who it was he imbraced. But this cannot be done now, content your ſelf therefore with the aſſurance which I doe make unto you, that what ſhall paſſe betwixt us ſhall never be diſcovered unto any.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amye</hi> was amazed to underſtand that <hi>Clerantes</hi> knew of her loves, and undoubtedly believed that he had a familiar ſpirit, and deliberating a little with her ſelf what a handſome Man he was, and of how great a quality, and what benefits for her part ſhe might receive from him, ſhe reſolved with her ſelf not to be too rigorous, nevertheleſſe ſhe ſaid unto him, You doe accuſe me of a fault which I never did commit, neither will commit at this time; for that which you demand belongeth to my husband, and I have promiſed to preſerve it for him. You ſhall receive more from me, ſaid <hi>Clerantes,</hi> than I ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> take from you, we ought not to be angry when another ſhall ſow our ground with his own ſeed. But my Husband, ſaid <hi>Amye,</hi> is conſcientious, and will not keep the fruits that ſhall in that nature be produced. Say you ſo (ſweet Friend) ſaid <hi>Clerantes,</hi> Send them home to me, they ſhall be in a good and a ſafe hand.</p>
            <p>After theſe words he found no more reſiſtance. In this manner they paſſed away two long hours and as one of our Hawks made a flight into the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent meadow, I beheld the Garden door to open, and galloping towards it, I arrived juſt as they were bidding one another Farewell. O Madam, ſaid I, Tell me now, Is not the Lord <hi>Clerantes</hi> of approved valour? Yes certainly, ſaid ſhe, The Victory betwixt us will always evenly be ballanced, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as we regain new ſtrength, ſometimes the one, ſometimes the other will have the advantage.</p>
            <p>In this gentle concluſion we did take our leaves of her, and all along the way we did not ceaſe to admire her ſpirit, of which
<hi>Clerantes</hi> did give me ſo many proofs, rehearſing to me all the diſcourſe which ſhe had with him in my abſence. I gave thanks unto Love for the good fortune he received.</p>
            <p>Some time afterwards Letters were directed to him to return unto the Court, to which (for all his oathes to the contray) he was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to go, and propounding to my ſelf what was the neceſſity that did inforce him to it, I did what I could to render the journey agreeable unto him.</p>
            <p>By nature he was very ambitious, and the deſign which he had to lead a private life, did only proceed from his inability to imploy himſelf in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of States. But having obtained the favour of the King as much as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at the laſt he deſired it more particularly, and to have his Countenance altogether, and aſpiring to places of great Authority, he did now more loye the Court than before he hated it, ſo that at the laſt I was delivered from the trouble, by ſtudying any more, by my praiſes, to make the Court to appear pleaſant to him.</p>
            <p>He ſollicited my advancement as much as poſſibly he could, and at the laſt he procured that I had the countenance of the King, who a long time had known me before. I did aſſiſt him my ſelf in my preferment, and ordinarily did hold diſcourſe with the King, in which he obſerved a certain acuteneſſe of Spirit that did much delight him. Do you conceive that I became more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in my own conceit, and that I more eſteemed my ſelf, becauſe that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day I made freely my addreſſes to the King? I proteſt unto you No; It was a thing but indifferent to me. I am not of the humour of that honeſt French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who boaſted that he made his approaches ſo near unto the King in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ceremony, that the chafe of his Scabbard did touch his cloaths; Neither <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59287:90"/>will I reſemble my ſelf to another, who with great glory did ſhew to all the world the ſpittle which from his Majeſties mouth did caſually light upon his Cloak as he paſſed in the ſtreet by him: Such a ſimplicity is not gracefull to me; I ſhould rather commend the rudeneſſe of the Country man, who, his his Companion deſiring him to leave off his labour to come to look upon the King, who was riding through their Town, did make anſwer, that he would not take ſo much as one ſtep out of doors to ſee him, for the King was but a man no more than himſelf.</p>
            <p>I received the favours which his Majeſty vouchſafed me, with a ſpirit that always preſerved it ſelf in the ſame temper, and which never would ſuffer it ſelf to be tranſported into any diſdainfull motion. In his preſence I oftentimes would bitterly inveigh againſt ſome Gentlemen, who, I conceived, did deſerve it. Nevertheleſſe their Ignorance was ſo abhominable, that the greateſt part of them did believe it nothing did concern them, or elſe would fall a laughing as others did believing (ſuch fools they were) that what I did ſpeak was not to have them to retire from their follies, but only to feed them with new pleaſure. True it is, there was one amongſt them called <hi>Baiamond,</hi> who had more apprehenſion, but not more wiſdom than the reſt. He was a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Fool, neither would he turn into ſport the jeers of other men, nor ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from committing thoſe faults for which he was reprehended. All the Satyres that were compoſed at the Court had no other ſubject but himſelf, he was a Theam of ſcope enough for all the Poets of the Town to exerciſe their wits on, which cauſed him to ſwear that the firſt that made mention of him in mockerie ſhould be grievouſly puniſhed if he could but arrive to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him.</p>
            <p>One day when I was in the <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uvre</hi> I diſcourſed of diverſe things with ſome of my friends, and we came to talk at laſt of the great plumes of Feathers then in faſhion; ſome commended the uſe of them, others who were more preciſe did condemn them: For my ſelf I did much extoll them, as diverſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accoutrements which pertain to the ornament of Gentlemen, howſoever I could not approve I ſaid) the humour of ſome ſenſeleſſe Courtiers, who glorifie that they have feathers as great as the Mules of the Kings ſtable, which they would have to ſerve them as a ſhade, and when the Sun ſhines they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually do look down upon their ſhadowes to obſerve how gracefully they become them, and with theſe Feathers they hope to charm the reſolutions of the moſt obdurare Ladies.</p>
            <p>I have lately (ſaid I) heard the hiſtory of an amorous young Gentleman, who did lay forth as much money on feathers only, as on all the other habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he did wear, and yet, for all that, could never mollifie the hard heart of his Miſtreſſe.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I had ſpoken thoſe words all the Company entertaining a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that I would not recite any ſtale Hiſtory, did intreat me with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to rehearſe it to them, and I did thus begin.</p>
            <p>I muſt then, Gentlemen, begin my Account with a Count of whom I make no account. Immediatly <hi>Baiamond,</hi> who was behind us, and did always wear a great plum of feathers in his Hat, and who alſo was a Count himſelf, did imagin that I had an intent to bring him upon the Stage. He drew therefore more near unto us to underſtand the ſubject of my Diſcourſe. He (ſaid I) of whom I am to ſpeak, did fall in love with the Daughter of a Phyſician of this Town, for he had never the courage to carry his Deſires to a more eminent place. He for the moſt part did frequent the Church, to which ſhe repaired to hear Maſſe in the Morning and Veſpers in the Evening, and oftentimes he would walk by the Door of her Fathers Houſe, to enjoy the opportunity to behold her; At the laſt, he adviſed with himſelf to lodge in a Chamber ready furniſhed, that was directly over againſt her houſe, hoping that the proximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <pb n="16" facs="tcp:59287:91"/>of the place would bring ſome contentment to him, for the preſent, and be a happy means for the manifeſtation of his love for the time to come. One of his Lackeys was commanded to court her Servant, pretending to be amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of her; He was obedient to the command, and in a ſhort time he gained the favour of the Maid, ſo that his Maſter did diſcover unto him the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he did bear to the Daughter of the Phyſician, and deſired his indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to aſſiſt him. This affair of his did meet with marvellous ſucceſſe. At laſt the Maid Servant being very familiar with her young Miſtreſſe, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned all things in the houſe after her Mothers deceaſe, did acquaint her with the great love which her Neighbour over the way did bear unto her, for which ſhe was extremely checked, her young Miſtreſſe being highly incenſed, becauſe ſhe favoured the ſuit of ſuch a man, who by the greatneſs of his birth and fortunes, did make love unto her to violate her honour, any not to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſe her, and was forbidden for the time to come to bring any ſuch Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges unto her. The poor ſerving Maid was exceſſively ſorry that ſhe could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form nothing for him. who had promiſed her ſuch extraordinary rewards, Nevertheleſſe to draw ſome profit from him, ſhe made him believe that he was paſſionately beloved by her Miſtreſſe. She needed not to make many proteſtations to induce him to entertain this belief, for he had more vanity than any other in this age. When he paſſed through the ſtreets, he would turn him on every ſide to ſee if any did obſerve him, and if any one perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture did faſten his eye upon him, being amazed at his prodigious pride, he would imagine that he entred into admiration, either at the ſymmetry and proportion of his Body, or at the richneſſe of his habit. If a word were ſpoken on ſome other ſubject as he paſſed by, he did take it as ſpoken on himſelf, and expounded all to his own advantage; If a young Girl had but looked upon him, he ſtedfaſtly did believe that ſhe was amorous o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of my Perivigge, that ſhe did bear a greater affection to me than to your ſelf, I was afraid that my preſence would make her refrain from beſtowing thoſe favours on you which you may deſire, and do deſerve. Thoſe who did acquaint me with the ſtory of this vain perſon, whom they knew very well, did give me an account of a thouſand ſuch follies he committed. The Daughter of the Phyſician, without making any experimental practice of him, did in a ſhort time perceive of what hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour he was. The Windows of his Chamber were always open when he did put on any new ſuit of Apparel, or did any other thing in which his magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence did appear, and at dinner always, or at ſupper, the diſhes for a little time were placed in the window, that the good cheer he made might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held.</p>
            <p>This was the cauſe that ſhe did rather hate than love him, and related all his vanities to ſome of her choiceſt friends, who one Evening came into her chamber to take ſome pleaſure at the apiſh tricks of her Servant, who when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as ſhe came to her window, would be ſure always to be putting out his head at his own It ſo came to paſſe that there was a Gentleman with him who played very well upon the Lute, he intreated him to give him a Leſſon or two, and that he might not be ſeen, he did conceal him in a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent place hard by the window; In the mean time he did take another Lute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own hand, and ſtanding at the window he ſo fingerd it, that it might be believed by thoſe who ſtood in the window over againſt him, that it was <pb n="17" facs="tcp:59287:91"/>he who played, hoping that his Miſtreſſe would be the more inamoured on him, having made it apparent to her that he was indued with ſo Gentleman-like a quality; but as it fell out moſt unfortunately for him, one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of the Daughter of the Phyſician, who could play well on that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, perceiving by his ſtops, and his unskilfull touching of the ſtrings, that it was not he who made the harmony, did goe into a Room which was a pair of ſtairs higher, where they plainly diſcovered who it was that played. To make ſport therefore with the Count, ſometimes they told him that his Lute was out of Tune, ſometimes that he did touch the ſtrings too rudely, ſometimes that he had broke his Trebble; Nevertheleſſe for all that the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick continued a long time. The Phyſicians Daughter continuing at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, he remembring that he had read in the Romances, that ſome Lovers did even ſwoun away in beholding their Miſtreſſes, he, to ſhew the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of paſſion, ſtanding at the Window, did counterfeit himſelf to be in a great feebleneſſe, and cloſing his eyes, and opening his mouth, as if he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for a little breath, he fell gently down into the Chair behind him, and his window immediatly was commanded to be ſhut<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman ſuſpecting what it was, did ſend one of her Servants to his lodging to underſtand what was the malady that with ſo ſudden a violence had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized him, ſeeing that but a little before he ſeemed to be very well, when he played on his Lute at the Window. The Meſſenger being brought into his Chamber; Friend, ſaid he with a feeble voice, Acquaint your Miſtreſſe, that what ſickneſſe I have, ſhe only is the occaſion of it. This anſwer being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it did adminiſter to her a new and a greater ſubject of laughter. Her Maid Servant being ſtill willing to perform ſome ſervice for our Count, did aſſure him by his Lackey, that within few days ſhe would procure him the means to diſcourſe wi h her Miſtreſſe, and to proceed further peradventure, if the Doctor her Father, who did keep her ſo ſhort, could be imployed for a while in the Country. It being repreſented to the Count, that peradventure this Doctor would continue always in the City, if ſome invention were not practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſend him in the Country, he reſolved with himſelf to take ſome Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar who was ſick out of <hi>Paris,</hi> and having ſent him to his Signiory in the Country, to intreat the Doctor his Neighbour to take the pains to ſee him, and adminiſter Phyſick to him, making him believe that he was one of the Grooms of his Chamber whom he much tendred.</p>

Now was the time for the Maid ſervant to act her part. She ſaid unto her Miſtreſſe, you are too blame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth to make no more eſteem of this brave Monſieur, who every day doth by his look too much accuſe you of your cruelty; who knows but that it is his reſolution to marry you, although he is more rich than your ſelf?

               </gap> Miſtreſſe deſiring to make ſome mirth with the Count, did not reprove her Maid at that time, but aſſured her ſhe was not much unwilling to enjoy the converſation of her Lover. She immediatly did acquaint the Lackey with it, and in the twinkling of an eye, behold my young Count was arrived at the Houſe of the young Gentlewoman, who had thoſe in her company who not long before had ſeen him in his own window to ſwoun away. After ſome words of courteſie, they came by courſe to others which did not ſo much pleaſe him, becauſe that ever and anon they gave him ſome touch or other,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59287:92"/>to which he could return no anſwer. You are to obſerve, that when he was to addreſſe himſelf to any company, he did learn ſome complements by heart, which he did take out of the Academy of Love, and theſe complements he would repeat over and over, although the diſcourſe was not on that ſubject, which did render him troubleſome and tedious unto all that heard him; I leave to you to judge, if at this preſent he had not turned over all the Books of Love, to collect from thence ſome Flowers of Oratory, and if that by his language it might not eaſily be underſtood that he had read
<hi>Nerveza,</hi> and yet for all this he would oftentimes fall ſhort, or be extremely out, eſpecially if he was put upon a ſubject on which he had not read that Morning. As for his paſſionate Love he had not the opportunity to ſpeak much unto his Miſtreſſe thereupon, and he received nothing but cold and unſatisfying anſwers from her; inſomuch that he began to repent that he had abuſed her Father in a needleſſe journey ſo far out of the City. Not long afterwards the Doctor being returned, did carry his Daughter to a little houſe which he had bought, about a mile from <hi>Paris,</hi> and his buſineſſe not permitting him to ſtay long there, he almoſt every day did come back into the City. His Daughters ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant having a greater deſire than ever to aſſiſt the Count, demanded of her Miſtreſſe, if ſhe could not be well contented, being all alone to, give a little entertainment to her Servant. She made anſwer, yes, thinking ſhe had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of a young Gentleman one of her own degree, who made Love unto her, but her Maid Servant did not move according to that Bias, but adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Count that her Miſtreſſe, whoſe love had overcome him, did paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately deſire his preſence. On that Evening he did not fail to retire unto the Village, and the Maid Servant cauſing him to enter at the Garden door, did bring him to the Granary, where ſhe intreated him to hide himſelf, for fear of being ſeen, under ſome old and ragged Coverlets, promiſing him as ſoon as it was night, that ſhe would come and conduct him to her Miſtreſſe; afterwards ſhe repaired to her, and ſmiling ſaid, The Gentleman is come, I have cauſed him to conceal himſelf above under the Coverlets which are there. Her Miſtreſſe ſuſpecting of whom ſhe ſpake, determined with her ſelf to take vengeance on him for his boldneſſe to hide himſelf in her houſe, as if he had a deſign to raviſh her of her honour; and becauſe her ſervant ſhould not hinder her determination, ſhe only nodded with her head to her, and ſent her in an errand to the further end of the Town; ſhe was no ſooner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, but ſhe called the Keeper of her Vineyard, and his Son, and cauſing each of them to take a good ſtaff in their hands, ſhe did bring them both to the Granary. The Count the better to take air, did keep his head without the Coverlets, but hearing the noiſe which coming up the ſtairs they made, he did hide himſelf under them again.</p>
            <p>Being entred into the Granary, the Daugher of the Phyſician did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to beat the Coverlets as hard as they could to make the Duſt fly out. The Keeper of the Vineyard told her that her beſt courſe was to take take them down into the Court, and to have them beaten and ſhaken there, but ſhe made a round anſwer, and told them plainly, ſhe would not have them touched but only with their Cudgets. Having ſpoke theſe words ſhe returned to her Chamber, in the mean time the two Peaſants began to lay about them, and to beat the Coverlets with all the force they had, which were not thick enough to defend the Count from feeling the Blowes, which did fall like hail upon him.</p>
            <p>This exerciſe being nothing agreeable to his eaſe, he reſolved to put an end unto it, and ſuddenly ariſing up, he laid the Son of the Vine-keeper on the ground with one blow of his fiſt, and running down the ſtairs, he took his courſe more ſwift than a purſued Stag, directly to his Lackey. He knew not well afterward, whom to be angry with, either the Miſtreſſe or the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, <pb n="19" facs="tcp:59287:92"/>and perceiving himſelf affronted in the higheſt nature, he turned all his love into diſdain, and took his lodging that night in a place far from his ungratefull Miſtreſſe, and ever ſince he hath avoided that ſtreet, as the way unto the Gibbet. Following the King the other day, who paſſed by that place, It was told me, that he took his leave of a great Peer of the Realm, who of his own accord did offer to accompany him to the Rendezvouz of the Court, which was interpreted to be a great incivility, becauſe the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it was not fully underſtood.</p>
            <p>But this was not his Maſterpiece, for you are to take notice that he had a relliſh as well of the exerciſes of <hi>Mars,</hi> as of
<hi>Venus.</hi> He had not been long in the Univerſity, but he was poſſeſſed almoſt with an obſtinate deſire to make experience of his valour. He obſerved that no Gentleman was reſpected un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he had fought a Duel or two, therefore when he was high in wine he had a great deſire to quarrel, and to raiſe his diſcontent to ſuch a height of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence, that it might ſeem worthy of a challenge. But he was no ſooner freſh and in good ſenſe, but he conſidered with himſelf that he might as well be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, and mortally wounded, as be a Conqueror. He had no mind to that ſport. He would only be beaten as <hi>Belleroze</hi> was in the Comedy; He would have the thing done, which was yet to be done, and if poſſibly it could be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, he indeavoured that ſome Man of Credit, troubled by a falſe viſion, ſhould publiſh to the world that he had ſeen him in many dangerous incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, although he never was really in any.</p>
            <p>At that time there was at the Court a Baron of a phantaſtical humour, who being one of the Counts acquaintance, did comply with him in all things. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a long time diſcourſed of Duels, and of the valour of the Age, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded on a project for Honour, which ſhall be memorable through all poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Since all the Worl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> did beat on another, they had a deſire to beat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without expoſing themſelves to that danger as ſo many other young Fools are accuſtomed to doe, They were expreſſely reſolved to make a tall quarrel in ſome eminent company, and immediatly afterwards having ſeverd themſelves, they plotted to be found in ſome place out of Town with their ſwords drawn (ſwords that had no more metal in them than their Maſters) with which they ſhould make a flouriſh, and traverſe their ground, and keep a claſhing, until ſome ſhould clap in to part them, it matter'd not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were Travailers, or ſome of their own Grooms, who muſt know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their counterfeit valor, becauſe they might ſpeak afterwards of their Combat to the greater advantage. The Count, flattering himſelf with a belief that this was the only way to procure him Reputation, did ſay, And what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is there in it? Shall we ſin againſt the laws of Virtue? Is it raſhly done to enter into thoſe rages in which we obſerve many of the Nobility to be day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ingaged? Why ſhould not we make a gallant venture of our lives as well as they? And becauſe in theſe times Men are only eſteemed by the number of the Duels they have fought, we muſt, although diſſemblingly, practiſe the ſame Arts, becauſe there is not other way to gain us reputation. Let us put the Caſe, that ſometimes a kingdom may be given to a Man for committing ſome evil act, he who hath not committed the act, but hath diſſembled he hath done it, to gain the Crown, will ſtill find comfort in himſelf, how cruelly ſoever other men judge of him. Let us accomodate our ſelves to the Age, and make an advantage of our misfortunes, if we cannot remove them. The other approving his reaſons and reſolutions, they concluded upon ſome phantaſtical ſubject to quarrel in the Tilyeard in the preſence of divers Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen. The Count affirmed, it imported not if the occaſion of the quarrel was never ſo ſmall, for they who fight Duels on the leaſt occaſions, are the only men, who are now eſteemed, becauſe they make ſuch little reckoning of <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59287:93"/>their lives, which on all occaſions they doe hazard. In this reſolution, the Baron and the Count taking horſe, they parted from their Company by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways, and paſſing over Newbridge towards the Evening they came to <hi>Cherks</hi> Field, where alighting from their horſes, they took their ſwords in hand. They made choice of a place where they might be ſeen of all, ſo that they no ſooner made a claſhing with their ſwords, but the Citizens and the Souldiers did make haſt to part them. One who ſtood near unto them did ſwear unto me, that the Count even then ſaid unto the Baron, Be not ſo violent in your motion: Make but gentle thruſts, and ſuch as eaſily I may put by. Moreover it was obſerved, that they did fight in the ſame poſture as if they were dancing the Pyrrhique dance, obſerving a tune and method in claſhing their ſwords one againſt the other. This nevertheleſſe was not taken notice of, and they were intreated to be reconciled. To this counſel they were very obedient, and they did put their Swords into their ſcabbards again, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting themſelves to allege, that it ſtood neither with reaſon nor honour to make their <hi>paſſadoes</hi> before ſo many people.</p>
            <p>Aſcer this, their friends arrived, having followed them upon an imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they were gone to fight with one another. They came back together into the City, where they were made good friends, and their deſperate Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell was every where publiſhed, to the advantage as well of the one as of the other. Tell me, was not this an Heroical reſolution? and if in their in Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they had taken any fall by which they were hurt, could they not make the people believe that they were ſcars which they had received in ſome former Duell? Me thinks when they fought they might have clapped to their ſides a hoggs bladder full of blood, by which they might have counterfeited them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be wounded. Nevertheleſſe, for all this Artifice, their glory hath been ſince renowned over all the Court, as hath been the glory of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who are no more valiant than themſelves. I had not known their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, were it not for one of their Grooms, who did conceal himſelf in the Chamber of the Count when they made the plot, and ſince hath publiſhed it. The Count did find himſelf ſo highly and generally eſteemed for having ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded his life in this ſingle fight, that he hath been ever ſince dazled with the overcoming ſplendor of his own glory. The other day he would have challenged one of the Kings Receivers, becauſe he ſaw him too often in the houſe of a Gentlewoman whom he loved, but he was confident before hand that he would never anſwer him, although according to the colours he did wear he was habited like a man of the ſword. He did write a challenge to him, the form whereof he did take out of
<hi>Amadis,</hi> and ſent it by the Groom of his chamber. The Receiver, having read it, did return this Anſwer, Tell your Maſter, that I am not at this preſent in a diſpoſition to fight. I am a Man of peace, and will ſatisfie him in whatſoever ſhall be requiſite: Let him i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin that he ſees me in the field with my ſword in my hand, and fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; Let him imagin that he hath laid me on the ground; Let him publiſh it throughout the City, I will acknowledge it. For the preſent, I doe confeſſe my ſelf overcome, and without any fighting I demand of him that he would grant me my life. It is my beſt courſe, I do find, ſo to do, and to prevent the Evil rather than attend it. Would it be diſcretion think you to implore the mercy of my Enemy after he hath given me my deadly wound? Whether the Receiver did ſpeak this in Earneſt or in Jeſt is not much materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; but howſoever it was, the Count was effectually contented, and did boaſt to every one whom he did meet, how gallantly he had overcome this Man, who did every day ſo out-brave him, inſomuch that for his imaginary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, he believed he deſerved almoſt as magnificent triumphs as the Romans heretofore for their greateſt Archivement.</p>
            <p>This was the Story I did account unto them, which was no ſooner ended, <pb n="21" facs="tcp:59287:93"/>but all thoſe who heard it, did intreat me to give them the name of the Count, which was more than I could doe, for I ſwear unto you, that thoſe who did rehearſe it to me did conceal his Name.</p>
            <p>Count <hi>Baiamond</hi> having heard ſome part of my diſcourſe, looking with a diſcontented Eye upon me (for which I could not imagin the cauſe) did retire himſelf from our company. One of our Number having obſerved it, &amp; knowing withall the vanity of his humour, did laughing at him declare, that he believed the ſubject of my diſcourſe did reflect upon him. For my ſelf, I had at the leaſt the ſame belief, although I did not divulge it. And ſurely we did not deceive our ſelves; for he was a great part of that which I had ſpoken, as afterwards he made it appear by the vengeance he would take of me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that I had done him an unpardonable wrong, by rehearſing a Story which belonged to himſelf.</p>
            <p>One Evening, returning late from a Ladies houſe with whom I long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed, I was incountred by the way with the Groom of his Chamber, whom at that time I did not know, who told me that at the corner of the next Street there was a Gentleman, one of my friends, who deſired to ſpeak with me! Behold how well a treacherous heart doth know how to make uſe of his own time. I was on Foot, and had none to follow me but my little <hi>Biſcayn</hi> who was unarmed, becauſe I came from a place, to which, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to conceal my ſelf from publick obſervation, I would not goe with any great Equipage.</p>
            <p>I had no miſtruſt of him, and talking of many things I did goe along with him, receiving by the way many teſtimonies of a good diſpoſition: Croſſing the way where was a Lanthern with a Candle in it, according to the cuſtom of the City, he did caſt his eyes upon my Sword, and ſaid unto me, Sir, you have there, I ſee, an excellent hilt, Is the Blade anſwerable to it? let me ſee I pray you. He had no ſooner ſpoke the word but I did put the ſword into his Hand: He immediatly unſheathed it to ſee if it were well poiſed, And as he was giving me his Judgement of it, we came into a cloſe lane, where, as dark as it was, I diſcovered ſome Men who did hide themſelves in the porches of ſome of the buildings, to whom he ſaid, Sirs, ſee where he is; Be of good courage my Companions. Immediatly they did all draw their ſwords to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault me, and I having not then my own to aſſiſt me, I took a Piſtol out of my Pocket, which being diſcharged at random, I had not the leiſure to charge it again, therefore I did commend unto my feet the charge of my ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I did run with ſo much ſpeed, that it was impoſſible for them to overtake me, and I protected my ſelf in the ſhop of a paſtry Cook which I found open. As for my Lackey, he ſled directly to the houſe of <hi>Clerantes,</hi> who cauſed all his Gentlemen, the Grooms of his Chamber, and his Lackeys, to come forth to my aſſiſtance, but they could neither find me nor thoſe who aſſaulted me. Fearing to be diſcovered by my Enemies, I took upon me to be one of them, and did paſſe along the ſtreets crying, where is he? It was my fortune to paſſe by a houſe, which a long time I had known to be a Bawdy houſe, and being called unto out of the window, ſix or ſeven men came forth into the ſtreets, and conſtrained me to enter in to play at Dice with them, I ſtaked a teſton to every one of them, and in the way of curteſie emptyed all my Fobb upon the Table, and although I had not won much of them, they did ſwear unto me, that I muſt ſing them a Song for their Silver; I did ſing one of the beſt that I had, which they never heard before. After that, one of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of me, If I would play again that they might win back their money? I made anſwer, With all my heart. As we were throwing the Dice, I heard a young Fellow ſay to one of the Maid ſervants, We have done nothing this Evening on the Enterpriſe which we were to perform for Count <hi>Baiamond,</hi> againſt one whom we knew not, he moſt unfortunatly is eſcaped out of our <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59287:94"/>hands, being brought unto us by that gallant young Blade, who did goe along out of this houſe with us.</p>
            <p>By thoſe words I underſtood that I was amongſt my Aſſaſſinates, who were ſuch Villains, that for a little money they would kill a man in cold blood. Howſoever I was glad to underſtand that it was he who would have cauſed me to be killed by a treachery ſo diſagreable to a Man who carried the title of Nobility. Having loſt all my ſilver, becauſe I did not mind my play in liſtning to what was ſpoken, I had free leave to depart the Houſe, and took my way towards
<hi>Clerantes</hi> houſe, whom I hoped to have made merry, in appearing before him in that Equipage in which I then was, and in accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him the dangers from which I was miraculouſly delivered. I knocked as loud as I could at the Gate which was ſhut againſt me, becauſe that thoſe who were ſent forth to aſſiſt me were all retired. A Switzer who was half aſleep and half drunk, did come unto the Gate, and demanded, who was there? I made no anſwer to him, but only by the repeated knocks of the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; He ſaid, that his Lady had forbid that any noiſe ſhould be made, being indiſpoſed in her health, and moreover thus proceeded in his diſcourſe, Fool, if you will not hold your hand, I ſhall give you that which ſhall ſtick by you. In the name of God, what is it you would have? My Lady cannot ſleep, and doe you come to make Muſick to her. Are you a Chanter? If you are a Chanter ſhew me your Tablature?</p>
            <p>Having propounded theſe goodly queſtions, he opened the Gate, and I ſaid unto him, Let me come, in I am <hi>Francion,</hi> but he not knowing me, and thinking that I asked for <hi>Francion,</hi> told me,
<hi>Francion</hi> hath nothing to do with you, nor with any that belongs unto you, He is not within. Speaking thoſe words he immediatly did ſhut the gate upon me, and departed without giving any ear to what I ſaid, ſo that being unwilling to make any more noiſe, becauſe the Lady was not well, I did put out my Candle, and did reſolve to walk again in the ſtreets, conſidering with my ſelf into what houſe I might beſt retire, for there were many men yet up, before whom I would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly appear, knowing well enough they would conceive that I had diſguiſed my ſelf for ſome diſſolute ends, and thereupon they would raiſe upon me a thouſand ſcandals, which they would publiſh at the Court.</p>
            <p>I was profoundly poſſeſſed with this thought, when I was ſtayd by the watch, who demanded of me whether I was going, and who I was? you may ſee who I am, ſaid I, by my empty Fobb, I am going home having loſt all my money at play. We were then very near to one of the Lanterns of the ſtreet, which cauſed them to obſerve ruy countenance, in which they diſcern'd I know not what that I did not look like ſuch a Gameſter. They therefore did ſuſpect me to be ſome guilty perſon, and the rather becauſe I had no Candle lighted, they therefore examined my Pockets, where they found a Piſtol, which confirmed them in their had opinion of me. You are a knave ſaid they, and have thus diſguiſed your ſelf to commit ſome murder; we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to have a ſtrict eye on ſuch people who take the ſame courſe as you doe; you ſhall goe along with us to priſon. Having ſpoke thoſe words they all took hold of me, and cauſed me to go along with them to the great Caſtle. I durſt not tell them that I was
<hi>Francion,</hi> although I knew well enough that they would let me goe as ſoon as I had but told them my name. I choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at this preſent to come out of their hands by ſome other way. I had hid my Purſe betwixt my ſhirt and my skin, which was the cauſe they could not find it, although it was the firſt thing which they did ſearch for, I deſired them to unhand me that I might take it out, and I did give them all that was in it. They did thank me for my liberallity, and without any more enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after my affairs, they did all conſent that I ſhould goe where I plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59287:94"/>I conceived with my ſelf it was not amiſſe to return to the Cooks houſe, where having undiſguiſed my ſelf, and believing that my enemies who watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for me were all retired, I did goe again to <hi>Clerantes</hi> houſe, where I no ſooner knocked at the Gate, but by good fortune the Switzer was awake, and rapping out many oathes he opened the Gate for me, and the fumes of the wine he drank being diſſipated, he knew me better than he did before, He did let me in, and as I demanded of him what a clock it was, becauſe he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo unwilling to open the Gate, he told me it was too morrow, which made me heartily to laugh, for he ſhould have ſaid it was a little paſt midnight: I did goe directly to my lodging, where I found that my ſervants, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of my bad fortune could not ſleep, ſuch an affection they did bear unto me, and were very diligent to have me to bed, where I needed not to be rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to cauſe me to ſleep.</p>
            <p>When day appeared I addreſſed my ſelf to <hi>Clerantes,</hi> and declared to him the adventures which on the night before had befallen me. And this procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his hatred to Count <hi>Baiamond,</hi> inſomuch that he asked of me if he ſhould acquaint the King with it, to demand juſtice of him. I much thanked him for his good will, which I beſeeched him not to imploy on that ſubject, being unwilling that his Majeſty ſhould trouble himſelf with our quarrels. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe I reſolved with my ſelf to ſtand on my Guard, and to goe abroad no more but with a good train, ſince I was aſſaulted at once, by <hi>Baiamond</hi> with ſo many people.</p>
            <p>I was ſorry that I had ſo deeply ingaged my ſelf in this quarrel by aſſuming too great a liberty of ſpeech, for there is no man ſo weak or impotent, who cannot be hurtfull enough, if he be armed with wicked and treacherous reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions; and I now at laſt perceived that to live at reſt, we muſt not indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to diſoblige any whomſoever, but to carry our ſelves towards all with a gentle and a complying mind, eſpecially at the Court, where there are ſuch mutinous Spirits, that they cannot endure that the Truth ſhould be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them; Nevertheleſſe I had a deſire to ſatisfie my honour concerning that affair; and having accidently met with Count <hi>Baiamond,</hi> I ſaid unto him; Count, Have you forgot the Vertues which ſuch a Monſieur as you, who make profeſſion of Nobility ought to practiſe? How comes it about, that on the other night you would aſſault your Enemy by High-way Rogues? Do not you know well enough who I am, and that I ought not to be dealt withall in ſuch a Nature? If I were the moſt infamous man in the world, you ought not for your own honour to have done it. If we have any quarrel, we may decide it by our ſelves without the aſſiſtance of any Seconds. <hi>Baiamond</hi> being touched to the quick, becauſe I reproached him for what he had done, and withall being deſirous to witneſſe to me that he was indued with a generous ſpirit, did make anſwer to me, that when I pleaſed a thorough account ſhould be given for the wrong I had done him at that preſent, and for my accuſing him for what was paſſed, I replyed to him that it ſhould be to morrow in ſome private place out of the City, which I would acquaint him with. It troubled me I muſt confeſſe to combate with ſuch a treacherous man, who had given ſuch marks of ſo baſe and ſo cowardly a ſpirit, and I perceived that I ſhould gain no great honour to overcome him. Nevertheleſſe, after dinner, I did ride forth at Saint
<hi>Anthonies</hi> Gate, having a great deſire to be diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this buſineſſe. At the laſt he arrived with a Gentleman who was as much my friend as his own, and who would not imploy himſelf to reconcile us, becauſe he was of a martial reſolution, and was glad to ſee us in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent reſolution to fight with one another, hoping that he ſuddenly ſhould diſcover which of us two had the braver ſpirit. <hi>Baiamond</hi> took him along with him, believing that I had one to ſecond me, but perceiving that I was alone, he deſired him that he would be pleaſed only to be a Spectactor of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. <pb n="24" facs="tcp:59287:95"/>We were on our way to
<hi>Charenton,</hi> where, as we were looking out for ſome place of retirement, wherein to execute our deſign, <hi>Lerontes</hi> paſſed by in his Caroach. He was all alone, as was the cuſtome of that Lord, who was pleaſed in private to recreate and entertain himſelf in private, being removed from all the noiſe and diſtempers of the Court.</p>
            <p>Civility did oblige us to ſalute him, and to ſpeak unto him, who obſerving that we were both armed with Rapiers, did ſuſpect the affair, and to hinder us from enterprizing any thing, he deſired us to make a little ſtay, without ſpeaking any more words. He then repreſented to us that the day being ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try hot, it were better for us to ſit in the ſhade in his Caroach, than to be on horſeback. We fearing that he would take offence, if we ſhould be ſo unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil as to deny him our Company (and the rather, becauſe we could find no excuſe to travel any further) did accept of his Love, and our Lackeys held our horſes. He caſting his eye on my Horſe he did like him exceedingly well, and ſaid, I will try if I can practiſe on Horſeback my old Rudiments, for all the heat of the Sun. Gentlemen, Doe not ſtir, I pray you.</p>
            <p>Speaking thoſe words, he planted himſelf in my ſaddle, and performed all the feats that belonged to a good Horſeman. In the mean time the Caroach was hurrying on towards <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Baiamond</hi> affecting an undanted genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, would often ſay unto me, Was it poſſible that this ſhould fall out ſo? For my ſelf I burned with impatience, and would have fought preſently, if it had been poſſible for us to fight in the Caroach. <hi>Lerontes,</hi> ſeeing that we were near unto
<hi>Conflans,</hi> had a deſire to walk thither on foot: We alighted from the Caroach, and did goe along with him to the fair Gardens, where I entertained him all the while with ſuch diſcourſe, as did not teſtifie the leaſt trouble of Spirit. When he beheld that it grew towards the Evening, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of us, if we would return to <hi>Paris</hi> with him? and deſired us openly to acknowledge to him what was the deſign we had. I replyed, our deſign was amorous, we were going this Evening to viſit a Lady in thoſe parts. I am ſorry then, ſaid he, that I have hindered your journey. And on thoſe words we took our leaves of him. He was no ſooner gone, but
<hi>Baiamond</hi> demanded if I would fight preſently? but his friend made anſwer that now it was unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, becauſe that night approached; at thoſe words he ſeemed more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and alleged that we had time enough, to which I readily did agree. Nevertheleſſe we did nothing, at all, but reſolved to defer the incounter until the next day, and for the preſent, we did return unto the City. <hi>Baiamond</hi> was then in his extravancies, and would take boat, alleging it was more cool and pleaſant to return by Water than by Land. We entred into the ſame Boat with him, having commanded our Lackeys to lead our horſes unto <hi>Paris,</hi> When we were half the way, he began to riſe up, and to ſtand upright in the Boat, and cryed out, O what a grief do I feel within me to attend ſo long for ſatisfaction for the injuries you have done me! I will delay my revenge no longer; let us fight in this Boat, here is room enough. He of us two who ſhall be killed ſhall have his Body thrown into the River that the affair may be concealed. There can no better courſe be found to avoid the proceedings of juſtice. Speaking thoſe words, he drew his Sword, believing that I would have done the like, but <hi>Monteſpin</hi> (for ſo he was called who did accompany us) taking hold of him by the Arm, did ſay unto him, What do you make account to do my friend? were there ever ſeen ſuch proceedings? If it ſhould be known to any what a motion you have made, they would condemn you for the extremeſt folly in the world. Have patience a little, we are not now in a place to fight Duels. Theſe words made him quiet, and yet for all that he ceaſed no to teſtifie the great deſire he had to begin the Duell, but upon my faith I plainly did perceive that he had not ſo great a deſire as he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; He was juſt of the homour of the Duelliſts of this age, who have alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59287:95"/>an extravagant Fury in their diſcourſe, and no reſolution at all in their Souls. I aſſure my ſelf, that amongſt a hundred who within theſe two years have been ſlain in duels, there were hardly four, who according to the Rules of true Generoſity have been carryed out of the Field. I can number unto you a great many of them who have danced, ſung, and ſhewed a thouſand vanities as they were going to the Duel, which was only to divert themſelves that they might not think of the danger that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s ſo near them.
<hi>Baiamond</hi> was of the ſame diſpoſition, and when we came to
<hi>Paris,</hi> finding our Horſes near the unto <hi>Arſenac,</hi> he was importunate that we ſhould all go to ſupper to <hi>Monteſpins</hi> houſe; he committed there a thouſand follies, he drank unto me, and did ſing a Song, but certainly he in that did reſemble little Children, who in the night time paſſing through a dark place, do ſing but only to charm their fear. At the laſt to witneſſe his valour all over, and to ſhew that in one day he would perform more than all the Gallants of the Court did ever imagin could be done, he returned to his former extravagancies, and taking his Sword, he ſaid unto me, If you have any courage at all ſhew it now, for now is the time to decide our quarrel. Let us goe down into the Court of this houſe, it is ſpacious enough for our Duel. I made anſwer, I will doe as you will have me, for I would have you know, that I refuſe not at any time to enter into the Combat with you, be it night, or be it day, it will be no more advantagious for the one than for the other. Give order therefore that the Torches may be lighted.</p>
            <p>This being underſtood, <hi>Montoſpin</hi> came unto us, and ſaid, God forbid he ſhould permit us to fight at ſuch an unſeaſonable hour, for the valiant always ought to have the Sun to be the witneſſe of their glorious Acts, and none but Thieves and guilty men doe in the night time uſe their Swords; and beſides that, the Torches could not give light enough to ſerve us in our enterpriſe. <hi>Baiamond</hi> made anſwer, that one Evening he was in the Company of two Gentlemen, who had agreed to play a game at Tennis, and that they had Torches lighted about the Tennis Court that they might ſee to play, if theſe were ſo impatient to play a game at Tennis, how much more ought we to be who were to fight a Duel? <hi>Monteſpin</hi> did repreſent unto him, that although we were in his own houſe, we ought either of us to fear a treachery, and that the Lackeys who held the lights might put them out, or carry them all on one ſide to give light only to that party whom they would favour, and moreover when we thought leaſt of them, they might aſſault and wound us in our backs. Theſe reaſons did ſuddenly cool the fiery ſpirit of <hi>Baiamond,</hi> for it was all but counterfeit, and if he knew that <hi>Monteſpin</hi> would have given way that we ſhould have fought by Torch-light, he would never have made mention of it. He made theſe Rodomantadoes out of a vain cuſtom he had uſed ever ſince he had been a learner in the Fencing School, and when he did expreſſe himſelf moſt higheſt, his heart did always at that time beat moſt. In effect, he did ſpeak only of the Duel, becauſe he was conſtrained to it, and did indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to amuze me by his connterfeit reſolution.</p>
            <p>At the faſt <hi>Monteſpin</hi> did cauſe us to lie in two beds which he had prepared for us, and in the morning he did indeavour himſelf to make us friends, alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that it would redound to our diſhonour, if we ſhould kill one another for nothing. I had no deſire that our difference ſhould be ſo taken up, ſo that I did leave
<hi>Monteſpin,</hi> and ſaid unto <hi>Baiamond,</hi> Let us goe then to look out him whom you wor of, to put an end unto our controverſie. He followed me, not knowing what I would ſay, and I then propounded to him to return unto the place where yeſterday we were, and to fight our Duel there.</p>
            <p>I charged my Enemy as violently as poſſibly I could, and gave him ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny blowes that he was hardly able to ſuſtain them. As I was ſtriking one blow with all the force I had, his horſe curvetting received it upon his eyes, which <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59287:96"/>were immediatly covered with blood, and did put him in ſuch a rage that he would be governed no more by the Bridle or the Spur. His Maſter had enough to do to ſave himſelf with all the art and induſtry he had, nevertheleſſe he carried him into a place full of dirt, where I followed him ſo cloſe that I might have killed him if I would, but I had no deſire to wound him in his back. I cryed out unto him to return. At the laſt he got ſo much power over his Horſe, that approaching to me he did give me a wound in my left Arm. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after he had hurt me, his Horſe did ſhake himſelf with ſuch a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den violence, that he did throw him into a Ditch full of dirt, where to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of my wound I might have given him a hundred mortal ones if I had a deſire thereunto. I was contented to put the point of my ſword to his throat, and to aſſure him, if he would not confeſſe that he owed his life unto me, I would take it from him. He who could not riſe from the place where he was, was conſtrained to ſubmit unto me in all things, and afterwards I did the beſt I could to aſſiſt him. I told him, if he had got ſuch an advantage over me, he would hardly have uſed me with that humanity, and becauſe, I ſaid, you ſhall not impute your misfortune to the diſadvantage that I was on Horſeback, and you on foot, and that our quarrel may at this preſent be decided, Let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin (if you pleaſe) the Combat again, becauſe I obſerve that nothing but you cloathes have received any prejudice by your fall. As I ſpoke thoſe words, <hi>Monteſpin,</hi> who followed us cloſe enough, did preſſe in upon us, and ſaid, No No, you have given both of you ſufficient proofs of your valour, you muſt not proceed ſo far as to have your controverſie determined by Death. It is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient <hi>(Francion)</hi> what you have demonſtrated, and I am the Witneſſe of it, that it was in your power to have killed
<hi>Baiamond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although the Count had confeſſed this himſelf, neceſſity forcing him thereunto, yet he was much perplexed to behold that
<hi>Monteſpin</hi> was preſent, who was as a judge of the fight, and were it not for the incommodity he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>received, that his cloaths were ſo full of Mudd that he was hardly able to ſtir in them, I do believe he would have begun the fight again.</p>
            <p>His Friend did lead him to a Village hard by, where he cauſed him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt himſelf, and for my ſelf I returned to <hi>Paris</hi> to take care of my wound. I declared what had befallen me to
<hi>Clerantes,</hi> who did publiſh it to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of
<hi>Baiamond,</hi> and withall inſiſted much on the Juſtice of my Cauſe, ſeeing the Count would have aſſaulted me by the greateſt treachery in the world, for a ſubject of no moment: It was brought alſo to the ears of the King, who very much reproved <hi>Batamond;</hi> And there was not ſo much as <hi>Collinet</hi> our Fool who did not highly exclaim againſt him for the Injury he would have done me.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, I was by every one extolled (I do ſpeak it without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption) and my courteſie was much commended which I exerciſed toward my Enemy, in that I would not kill him when it was in my power to doe it, and when the many indignities I received from him did provoke me to it. It undoubtedly did manifeſt that I had a great command over my Soul, that I would not ſuffer it to be misgoverned by the importunity and impetuouſneſſe of my Choler. By this occaſion I procured to my ſelf the favour of <hi>Protogenes,</hi> who was one of the braveſt Princes in
<hi>Europe.</hi> There was nothing in me which he eſteemed not. He much approved my diſcourſe, and the reaſons I did give for whatſoever I did ſpeak, and gave me liberty to expreſſe my ſelf freely before him, whether the ſubject were good or evil, knowing well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that I would not reproach any one but thoſe only who did well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it. One time I publiſhed a Satyr which I had made againſt a certain Lord, of whoſe degree I made no mention, nor of his name. There was at the ſame time another Lord in the Court, who believed the Satyr was made on himſelf, and complained of it to <hi>Protogenes,</hi> who with ſmiles told me <pb n="27" facs="tcp:59287:96"/>what he had heard to be reported. I made anſwer to him, My Lord, It is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to conclude, that he who made this complaint unto you is extremly vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for were he not, he would never imagin that theſe laſhing verſes did ſtrike at him. When I made the Satyre I knew not if there were ſuch a man in the world or not, and yet becauſe he hath all the Vices of other men, I have not whipped that Vice which is not in his Soul. Behold the Subject of his affliction, he ſhould have been more carefull of his honour, and not of himſelf made the world to underſtand what is the life which he doth lead at the Court. But grant that I had compoſed the Satyre on himſelf, if he were a wiſe man, he would not make the leaſt appearance to be moved at all. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that another Lord of the Court not long ſince did cauſe a poor Poet to be beaten for having defamed him in his verſes; But what think you was the Event of it? It reflected worſe on my Lord than it did before; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the poor Rimer received blowes on his back, in as vaſt meaſure and cadence as were the verſes which he made, yet the people were unſatisfied until they knew what was the offence he had committed; the occaſion being known and divulged, it was preſently concluded that the Lord confeſſed himſelf guilty, for what is the Sun the worſe if he ſhould be called dark by any man? Hereupon all the ſtreets in the City had no other diſcouſe but of my Lord and the Poet, and thoſe who had never heard of the Satyre before, had now an extreme curioſity to ſee it. Theſe reaſons were ſo well approved by Prince <hi>Protogenes,</hi> that he acknowledged the Lord had done himſelf the wrong in making a complyance againſt me, and the firſt time that <hi>Protogenes</hi> ſaw him afterwards, he acquainted him with ſome part of the anſwer which I made him, with which he was intirely ſatisfied, and received me afterwards into his cloſeſt friendſhip.</p>
            <p>I made an anſwer another time to <hi>Protogenes</hi> which did infinitely pleaſe him. We diſcourſed in his preſence of Gentlenes, Courteſie, and Humility. He demanded who it was whom we conceived to be the moſt humble in all the Court; A Poetaſter, who at that time was near unto him, did name a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Lord, who (he ſaid) had incomparable Courteſie and Complements, with which he did ſo well defend himſelf, that he was never overcome in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. You have reaſon ſo to affirm, ſaid
<hi>Protogenes,</hi> I have oftentimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him my ſelf, What doe you think of him <hi>Francion?</hi> What man is there ſo bold (ſaid I) as to differ in Judgement from you, whoſe Spirit is as great as your authority. I doe well perceive, (ſaid the Prince) that you have not the ſame thoughts as I have, I doe give you free permiſſion to ſpeak your mind. Well then, ſaid I. Take knowledge that I eſteem that man whom you call humble, to be one of the proudeſt men in the world, and obſerve my reaſon for it. The Complements which he doth give to thoſe who doe accoſt him, do not proceed from any knowlege of his own imperfections, but from an ardent deſire to appear to be a well-ſpoken man. He hath a Soul within him that is proud beyond meaſure, his Preſumption being inforced to diſcend, doth render it ſelf more humble than otherwiſe it would, when by complement he is conſtrained to expreſſe himſelfe. If we could read his heart within him, we might plainly diſcover how he doth but mock thoſe to whom he doth pleaſe to humble himſelf, and by whoſe praiſes he doth perſwade himſelf that he ought to be honoured for his Eloquence. For the reſt of him we may diſcover that he makes no value of thoſe to whom he doth communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelf, and yet he doth not ſeem to deſpite them, to the end he might invite them to interchange diſcourſe with him, and to advance him to the Skies, which doth tranſport him with an unbounded exceſſe of joy. Who is he that can deſcribe unto us what Pride is, if this be not?</p>
            <p>There were ſome who were ready to make a reply unto me, but the Prince ſtopped their mouths, and alleged that they did ſpeak unprofitably againſt <pb n="28" facs="tcp:59287:97"/>a thing which did carry in it ſuch an appearence of Truth, doing me the honour to prefer my reaſons above thoſe of other men.</p>
            <p>In this manner I paſſed away many moneths very happily, receiving day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from him ſome favours or other, and for a long time I did not eſtrange my ſelf from his preſence, as I have done ſince I fell in love with <hi>Loretta.</hi> Behold, Sir, I have here given you an account of the greateſt part of my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturs, If poſſibly I could be ſo happy I would learn yours, without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you to the trouble to rehearſe them, which is the reaſon that I dare not importune you to acquaint me with them. Signior <hi>Bourgignon</hi> did make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, It is a Maxime, that great Perſonages are the Maſters only of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, who either by their valour or their underſtanding do find an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſucceſſe in whatſoever they doe undertake, but vulgar ſpirits, and ſuch as mine, are not in that capacity. There hath never any fortune arrived to me which is worthy of your ear. You may be confident of it, and doe not believe that I ſpeak this to exempt my ſelf from any trouble, for there is nothing ſo difficult which I would not perform to pleaſe you. I doe believe then, ſaid
<hi>Francion</hi> that nothing extraordinary did ever diſturb your fortunes, and I am of opinion that it is a token of the felicity which Heaven hath imparted to you, not to ſend any ſuch troubles or dangers to you as to my ſelf; and it is a teſtimony alſo of your prudence, which hath kept you from the undertaking of things dangerous and uncommendable. If I had ſo much underſtanding as I ought to have, I ſhould not peradventure have committed ſo many extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies as I have repeated to you, but ſhould have demeaned my ſelf with greater circumſpection, I ſhould never have diſguiſed my ſelf into a Minſtrel nor have put my ſelf to the trouble to repeat and upbraid the vanities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which might have coſt me my life, and laſtly I ſhould have enjoyed far better fortune than now I doe, which might ſerve for an excellent example for all men in the World.</p>
            <p>The Signior of the Caſtle ſaid unto <hi>Francion</hi> that he ought not to complain of any thing that was paſſed, and that with a marvellous dexterity he had withdrawn himſelf from all manner of misfortunes. After this diſcourſe he briefly examined all that at ſeveral times
<hi>Francion</hi> had related to him, reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt on the Hiſtory of his youth, and having remembred that he had made mention of <hi>Raymond</hi> who had taken his ſilver from him, he told him that he underſtood by one of his Servants where he was, and that he dwelt not far from that Caſtle, ſo that at any time when he pleaſed he would goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> with him, it being but a journey of recreation. Talk not to me of him, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> I have no deſire to behold that man. He who from his youth did learn to play the thief, muſt needs be now of notorious experience, I will have nothing to do with him, nor any of his Company. I would have you know that my name is <hi>Raymond,</hi> ſaid the Signior, and on thoſe words he did begin to ſwear himſelf into an extravagant Choler, I will make you repent, ſaid he, whatſoever you contumeliouſly have ſpoken of <hi>Raymond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having ſpoke thoſe words he departed out of the Chamber, and violently did ſhut the door. <hi>Francion</hi> who had quite forgot his countenance, was very ſorry to hear theſe words to proceed from him, and was much aſtoniſhed that he ſhould be amazed for ſo ſmall a Trifle.</p>
            <p>The Stuart of the houſe came not until many hours afterwards unto him to bring him his Dinner, and then told him that his Maſter was ſo extremly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt him, that conſidering the ſeverity of his Nature, he ought to fear, ſeeing he had him in his own Caſtle locked up from the ſight and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the world, that he would take ſome great vengeance for the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces committed againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion</hi> all that day ceaſed not to entertain an infinite number of various thoughts concerning that ſubject, and with a great impatience attended to <pb facs="tcp:59287:97"/>underſtand the reſolution what
<hi>Raymond</hi> would doe with him. The Steward aſſured him that on the next day he would bring him certain intelligence of it; and he failed not to come unto him according to his promiſe, and aſſured him, that his Maſter had conceived ſo extreme a diſpleaſure againſt him ever ſince he had ſpoken ſomething to him on the day forgoing, that he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved he was reſolved to put him to death. <hi>Francion</hi> a long time delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with himſelf what offence he had committed againſt
<hi>Raymond,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to find it out, he was the moſt amazed man in the world. He was throughly recovered of the pain which he had in his head, and now he had no malady but in his Soul only. He would fain have put on his Clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Francion</hi> made anſwer, that they ſhould not take ſo much pains, for he deſired that not any but his own Man might come unto him, but anſwer was returned, that <hi>Raymond</hi> would not give way that he ſhould ſpeak unto him.</p>

<hi>FRANCION.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Adventures which <hi>Francion</hi> incountred in his minority have been already rehearſed in the forgoing Books, where, I have always brought him in, ſpeaking in his own perſon what were the fortunes that did attend him. It is now time that his Hiſtorian ſhould ſpeak for him, and deliver the reſt of his Adventures in the ſame ſtrain and method. And I am reſolved to doe it without taking care what it is, becauſe I have undertaken it, and it may ſuffice that I doe give upon it this particular advertiſement, that I have not found a more eaſie or more pleaſing remedy againſt the affliction which a long time hath poſſeſſed me, than to write a Hiſtory which ſhould be as delighfull as it is ſerious, ſeeing a ſad cauſe doth oftentimes produce a joyfull effect. Neither ſhall I regard the reproofs of ſome fooliſh perſons, who will blame me for this work, ſeeing the moſt ingenious Spirits that were ever known have vouchſafed to follow theſe ſtudies, and that our preſent life would appear too full of affliction, and too tedious, if we did nor take off the unpleaſing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of it with ſome delightfull interpoſure. It is to be too deſperately me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, to imagin that he who makes a profeſſion of Virtue, ought not to take any recreation at all. Let him act
<hi>Heraclitus</hi> who hath a mind to it, and weep at the follies of the world; for my part I had rather perſonate <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus,</hi> the moſt important affairs of this world being but as an Enterlude unto me. And ſeeing that laughter amongſt all living Creatures is only proper unto man, I believe it is not given him without great reaſon, and that he is not only allowed to laugh himſelf, but to make others to laugh alſo. It is true that my firſt deſign was not to make this contentment vulgar, nor to pleaſe a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people whom I doe not know, who may read this Comical Hiſtory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing printed, My intention was only in particular to pleaſe my friends; for I conſidered with my ſelf, that all the world eſteemed not this liberty of jeering mirth, not knowing that there is nothing more difficult than to be happy in it. Moreover, it did much trouble me to obſerve, that as ſerious things were only read by learned men, ſo vanities and follies were the proper ſtudies of the vain and ignorant, and that there is not ſo poor a Groom who doth not make it his buſineſſe to be taken with them. Nevertheleſſe, men of ſound Judgement have adviſed me to publiſh this Book, and have ſo prevailed upon me, that at the laſt I have obeyed their perſwaſions, and I am of a belief that my Book may pleaſe as well the wiſe men in the world, as the ſimple, although they differ <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59287:98"/>much in judgement. And becauſe it hath been approved by ſome who are the profeſſed lovers of wiſedom, I will confeſſe with them, that I have mingled pleaſure with profit, and that in deriding the vicious, I have ſo handſomly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved their Vices, that there is ſome hope left that it will adminiſter a good deſire unto them to correct themſelves, being aſhamed of their paſſionate actions. But it may ſo fall out, that I doe but flatter and deceive my ſelf, and I do entertain too high an opinion of my work, and of the diſpoſition of Men. I know there are a generation of people ſo ſtupid, that they will not profit by it, and will believe that all my diſcourſe is for no other purpoſe, but to give them pleaſure only, and not to correct their humours. It therefore will be objected to me, that to meet with all ſorts of men, it were my eaſieſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyeſt courſe ſeriouſly to reprove all ſorts of Vices, ſo that I might perſwade the wicked rather to repentance than to laughter; but there was one reaſon which hindred me from taking that way, which is, that I muſt uſe a certain ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice to draw and allure all the world. It is neceſſary that I ſhould imitate the Apothecaries, who with ſugar cover their bitter potions to cauſe them to goe down the better. A Satyr whoſe apparence had been fierce and wild would have diſwaded men from the reading of it by its title only. I ſhall only ſay, that by ſimilitude I do ſhew a fair Palace, which on the outſide hath the apparence to be filled with liberty and delights, but within there is nothing to be ſeen but ſevere Cenſures, unreprovable Accuſers, and rigorous Judges. Here are Fables and Inventions to be ſeen, which without all doubt will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the Ignorant to be full of ſimplicity, who have not the capacity to dive into the depth of them; Nevertheleſſe, theſe Fables doe contain ſuch Truths, that no man yet had ever the boldneſſe to repreſent them. I include alſo in this book the evil actions of perſons of authority, becauſe in theſe days we do not love to behold Truth ſtark naked, and I do take it for a maxim, That ſometimes we ought to hold our peace, that we might ſpeak more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a longer time, that is to ſay, it is good to moderate our paſſionate lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and to confine our ſelves to certain times, for fear that the great ones ſhould unreſiſtably apprehend us, and condemn us to a perpetual ſilence. I had rather loſe my good words than my good friends, and although I am a Satyriſt I would carry it with ſo good a grace, that thoſe men whom I doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove may not be offended at me. But when I reflect more maturely upon my work, that what if after all this, it ſhall loſe in its eſtimation; for I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready concluded, that it will be of no great uſe to reform the vicious, and that withall it will bring but little contentment to ſome of the ſevereſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Of all the Spirits which I know there are but a very few who are ſound enough to judge, for the greateſt part doe amuze themſelves on nothing elſe but to reprove thoſe things whoſe beauties they are not capable to diſcover. When a Book is publiſhed, we ought to have the Switzers in the Stationers ſhop to defend it with their Halberds; for there are a race of idle people who make it all their imployment to cenſure whatſoever is printed, and believe it is enough to confirm them to be gallant men, if they can but ſay, <hi>It is not worth any thing,</hi> although they can give no reaſon for it. Every man in theſe times will appear to be a man of an excellent underſtanding, although there was never known a more heavy &amp; a more predominant ignorance. A School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy who is hardly out of the danger of the laſh, having read but three or four French Books, will be ready to make as many himſelf, and believe himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſurpaſſe all others. But this would be nothing at all, if he did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue another to cry up his own reputation; but all reſpect and modeſty is abandoned, &amp; men will inforce themſelves to look out defects where none are to be found. For my ſelf, if I ſhould be ſo unfortunate as to treſpaſſe againſt the laws of Art in writing, yet I would have the world know that I doe not the leſſe eſteem of my ſelf, for I am not the Maſter of ſo baſe a Soul as <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59287:99"/>to imploy all my abilities on an Art, in which one cannot exerciſe himſelf without flatery or ſubjection. Having done nothing but only teſtified my hatred which I bear againſt the vicious, in a negligent and mirthfull diſcourſe, I doe believe that I have done enough. But I may ſpeak without preſumption, that I have not committed any fault ſo great that may make me bluſh, if any one therefore ſhall make it his buſineſſe to reprehend me, he ſhall but loſe his time to play the Critick on me, who am the Critick of other men, and it may be of himſelf; he ſhall but grate his Teeth on the Anvill. Let therefore this male-contented humour be abandoned by all men, and let me return to the agreeable ſubject of my diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>You ought to underſtand, that <hi>Francion</hi> was conſtrained to permit the Groom of <hi>Raymonds</hi> Chamber to apparel him in a rich habiliment, according to the faſhion of the antients, which by order from his Maſter he had brought unto him. He enquired of him, wherefore he did not apparel him in his own cloaths, or any other that were faſhionable, but he could receive no other anſwer, but only that he was obedient to the commandment of his Maſter, The Steward having afterwards acquainted him that <hi>Raymond</hi> had aſſuredly a reſolution to take him out of the world, <hi>Francion</hi> made anſwer, that he believed that in that habit of the Theater which he had ſent him, he would make him act his own Tragedy, in which he ſhould repreſent the part of ſome great perſon, who in times paſſed had been ſo put to death. The Steward replyed, I know not what he will doe, for with much difficulty have I learned that little which I have faithfully declared to you, out of a charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble compaſſion that you may the better prepare your ſelf to depart this world; And I would adviſe you, Sir, not to be ſo frolick as you are, for you are nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer your end than you do think for. <hi>Francion</hi> made anſwer, I cannot leave my ordinary humour, whatſoever misfortune can arrive unto me, and I can aſſure you, that he helps me only but to make a ſhorter cut in my way to death, in which we every one doe travell; for either ſooner or later we muſt all arrive at that Inn; Nothing afflicts me more than that I ſhall not dye like a Gentleman. If my King by Divine permiſſion ſhould have the news brought unto him of this cruelty, he would not ſuffer my death to be unpuniſhed.</p>
            <p>As he did ſpeak theſe words, they did put about his Neck a chain of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, and a Hat on his head, the band whereof was heavy with precious ſtones of a great value. I think, ſaid he, he will obſerve the cuſtom of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Romans, who crowned the Victims they were to ſacrifice with the moſt beautifull Garlands. You put upon me theſe rich ornaments to conduct me to my death; what need have I of this gorgeous attire? Being made ready, they told him he muſt goe whither they would lead him. He did conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, reſolving with himſelf to take hold in the way of the firſt Inſtrument of defence he could find, therewith to reſiſt thoſe who ſhould oppoſe him, for he had no deſire to be put to death without giving before hand ſome demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of his incomparable valour.</p>
            <p>In this reſolution he came out of his Chamber, wirh a countenance no more troubled than if he had been going to a Banket. I doe believe that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> being in the ſame condition would not have ſo unalter'd and ſo conſtant a Spirit. He paſſed with his conductors tbrough the Galleries and the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and in the way he liſtned to an Air that he had hererofore himſelf compoſed, which was ſung in a room that was not far from him. The Ditty was this.</p>

                  <hi>The Fair <hi>Beliza</hi> hath a Face,</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59287:99"/> This was ſome good preſage unto him, and conceiting with himſelf that his death could not be ſo near, he liſtned again to the voice which he heard, and collected to himſelf that he had heard the ſame voice ſome where elſe, but he could not tell where. At the laſt, behold where <hi>Collinet Clerantes</hi> Fool did come ſinging in before him, and imbraced his thighs with incredible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of affection. My good Maſter, ſaid he, where have you been all this while, I have been looking you out a long time, Now I have found you let us be merry together. <hi>Francion</hi> being much amazed to ſee <hi>Collinet</hi> there, did modeſtly cauſe him to withdraw himſelf, without laughing at any of his vanities, and told him that he would ſpeak more freely with him, when he was at leiſure. Being come to the door of the great Hall, he beheld a larg Square hung round about with Garlands of Flowers, and did there read theſe words which were written in Letters of Gold. <hi>Let none aſſume the boldneſſe to enter here, if he hath not a Soul that is truely generous, and renounceth not the opinions of the vulgar, and if he loveth not the pleaſures of Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion</hi> entred, being aſſured that it was permitted to him ſo to do, he found there four Gentlemen and five Gentlewomen, ſitting in chairs in a Corner, and moving no more than ſo many Statues. At the laſt one of the Ladies began to ſpeak, and gravely commanded him to repoſe himſelf on a chair which was brought unto him. My good Friend, ſaid ſhe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended <hi>Raymond,</hi> we are here preſent to arraign you. I deſire (ſaid <hi>Franci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> who much was amazed at theſe ſtrange proceedings) to underſtand what Crime I have committed againſt him. You do pretend to be ignorant, ſaid one of the Gentlemen, you ſhall by and by hear your charge.</p>
            <p>After that theſe nine Judges had diſcourſed amonſt themſelves to adviſe what ſentence they ſhould pronounce againſt him, the Lady who did ſpeak firſt of all, being ſeated in her chair again, did deliver her ſelf to this effect.</p>
            <p>Having conſidered the offences which <hi>Francion</hi> the moſt ungratefull and moſt perfidious Knight that ever ſought after perillous adventures, hath committed againſt <hi>Raymond,</hi> who did intreat him as courteouſly as was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. We do ordain that he ſhall be put into the hands of the moſt rigorous Lady of the World, to be puniſhed according to his merits.</p>
            <p>This judgement being pronounced <hi>Lorretta</hi> came forth, and
<hi>Francion</hi> was ſurrendred to her mercy. Never man was more amazed, he knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ought to rejoyce, or be ſad. <hi>Raymond</hi> immediatly entred, and imbracing him did take all amazement from him. He ſaid unto him, My dear Friend, This is the time that I will give you the teſtimony of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which I doe bear unto you, having prepared for you all the delights that I poſſibly can deviſe. I have ſent to ſeek out your
<hi>Loretta,</hi> that if you doe ſtill love her, her preſence may convey ſome ſecret joy unto you, and which is more, I have cauſed five Ladies to come hither, one whereof is my <hi>Helena,</hi> if you pleaſe you may make choice of her.</p>
            <p>Theſe four Gentlemen are the braveſt perſonages in this Country, and the moſt worthy of your Company. One of them is Signor
<hi>Dorini</hi> the Italian, of whom I have already ſpoken unto you, and for the others you will have ſufficient experience of their worth. All that we have to do is to deport our ſelves in the height of all Debauchments. The hatred which I pretended to bear unto you, was only to render now more gratefull the fruits of my love. I have ſo great an opinion of the conſtancy of your Soul, that I knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough the aſſurances that were made unto you, that undoubtedly you ſhould die, would cauſe no diſturbance in it. For the reſt I was conſtrained to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt my ſelf from ſeeing you, and to make you keep your Bed, that I might have the greater advantage to provide what I conceived to be neceſſary, and to indeavour to make you paſſe away this day in the exceſſe of pleaſure and delight.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59287:100"/>
               <hi>Francion</hi> made anſwer to him, that he could not believe he did bear that ill will unto him which was reported, and ſpeaking thoſe words they entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an obligation of an inviolable and a perpetual love to one another.</p>
            <p>This was that which paſſed betwixt <hi>Raymond</hi> and
<hi>Francion,</hi> and in effect <hi>Raymond,</hi> to gratifie him, did promiſe to make him ſuch cheer, that the like was never ſeen, and their debauchment was yet greater than can be imagined. Wherefore O you young men and maids, who have not yet loſt the flower of your Virginity, I doe here in a good time advertiſe you to read no further, but to skip over this Book, which doth make a rehearſal of thoſe things which you do not underſtand, It will be told me that I may leave it out, but know, that the Hiſtory would be imperfect without it, for in books of Satyres as this, it is the ſame, as in the bodies of Men, who when they are guelded are the Subjects of all mockery and hatred. I have already declared, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving undertaken to inveigh againſt all the vices of men, and to deride their follies, I ought to repreſent many things in their native colour, to make them the more ridiculous. There is nothing ſo unknown but ſenſual Men can ſpeak far more of it, which is the reaſon that we will adventure through all, and you are to conſider that it is done without the leaſt evil deſign, and merrily, only to paſſe away an hour or two.</p>
            <p>We will in this place declare, that <hi>Francion</hi> was not afterwards much ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to ſee himſelf ſo apparalled as he was, becauſe he beheld that <hi>Raymond,</hi> and the other Gentlemen were attired almoſt in the ſame faſhion. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies themſelves who were cloathed according to the ordinary faſhion, were conveyed into a Chamber, where habiliments were brought unto them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the faſhion in which we ſee Ladies many hundred years agoe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, and indeed there is nothing that doth make Ladies to appear more beautifull or majeſtical. At that time <hi>Agatha</hi> came to <hi>Francion,</hi> to do reverence unto him, to whom ſhe related, that ſhe had been in the Caſtle of <hi>Valentine,</hi> and pretending that ſhe would take his Niece along with her, to go ſome ten leagues off in pilgrimage, ſhe by that means had brought her to <hi>Raymonds</hi> Caſtle, according to the plot that was made betwixt them.</p>
            <p>It was there repreſented to her, that ſhe muſt goe and attire her ſelf as the reſt of the Ladies, ſhe demanding not the reaſon, being glad that once in her life ſhe ſhould ſee her ſelf gallant, did depart from <hi>Francion:</hi> Not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhe returned, being as it were tranſported with a ſudden joy, to acquaint the men that they ſhould follow her, and ſhe would ſhew them a pleaſant ſpectacle. One of the Ladies being gone out of the chamber where all the reſt were, did retire her ſelf into one of the fore-chambers, that ſhe might there accommodate her ſelf with the greater liberty. She had nothing on but her ſmock only, which ſhe had then taken off to ſhake the Fleas from it, and being ſtark naked ſhe began to rub her thighs, and to pare the nails of her feet: <hi>Agatha</hi> immediatly opened the door, of which ſhe had the key, and the poor Lady hearing the voice of Men at the door, did look out ſome place to hide herſelf, but <hi>Agatha</hi> had taken all her habiliments from her. She was ſeated upon a Bed to which there was neither Teſtor nor Curtains, there was nothing left but the Mat and the Bolſter, which ſhe thought good to cover her head with, that none might know who ſhe was. Being on the further ſide of the bed, ſhe did truſſe up her ſelf in ſuch a poſture, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be ſeen of her but her Poſteriors only. Every one did begin to laugh at the ſight of that goodly Object, and demanded of <hi>Agatha</hi> who that Lady was. She made anſwer ſhe would ſay nothing, ſeeing ſhe knew ſo well to conceal her ſelf. Whereupon <hi>Raymond</hi> alleged, ſhe only hides her ſelf after the manner of ſome Birds, who believe that if they hide their heads, no other part of their body can be ſeen. But it is not with her, as it is with thoſe Birds, ſaid <hi>Dorini,</hi> for we may diſcern and know them; howſoever by <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59287:100"/>their feathers, which always ſhew themſelves, but in this poſture we cannot know this Lady, although we had ſeen her ſtark naked before. <hi>Francion</hi> did approach unto her, and taking as full a ſight of her as poſſibly he could, he embraced her about her middle, ſtriving to pluck her from the Poſt of the Bed at which ſhe held faſt, that ſo having made her forſake her hold, he might turn her towards him to know who ſhe was by her face. But he could not force her from her hold. And as in that poſture ſhe ſhewed a pair or the plumpeſt But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks in the world, there was one preſent who cryed out by way of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Oh Gentlemen, what a ſight is this which I ſee! <hi>Raymond,</hi> who heard him, did immediatly reply, What is it that you do ſtartle at, and have in ſo much wonder? one of the moſt amiable parts of the whole Body. That which in your judgement doth ſeem to be filthy, and ought not to be expoſed to the ſight of the world, It is nothing elſe but the extreme ſuperficies of the thighes joyned together, I take as much delight to behold them as any other part of the Body. It is nothing but the opinion of the vulgar that doth render it diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, and they are not able to give a reaſon for it. I refer my ſelf to <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> he ſpeaks ſo himſelf of them in his Book of Wiſedom. On my faith you are too nice, we will all doe homage to them, the others replyed; Will you be the firſt that will begin?</p>
            <p>The ſcandalous Chronicle here doth add, that <hi>Raymond</hi> having ſpoke theſe words determined to put them into effect, and that
<hi>Francion</hi> who commended his deſign did make an Oration to thoſe goodly Demy-globes, which incited every one that was preſent to approach and kiſſe them, and that the Lord <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini</hi> going laſt of all did find moſt plainly a certain Northern wind to proceed from her ſally-port, which gave an ungratefull viſitation to his Noſe. I will not here amuze my ſelf to deſcribe all the particulars, which peradventure will not be pleaſing unto every one, nor aſſure you that what I heard concerning this, is altogether true, which is, that <hi>Raymond</hi> proceeding in his debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, would ſecond the gallantry of thoſe men, who in the ordinary tippling-houſes drinking in an old ſhooe, do mingle with their wine Cheeſe, and greaſe of Candles, and other honeſt ingredients, and that he ſending for wine, did pour it all along the back of that fair and naked body, and commanded all the reſt to come and drink it up at it was running down her cleft. Let us remove our obſervations from ſo ſlovenly an entertainment, and not to blemiſh the reputation of our Cavalliers, Let us imagin that they only contented themſelves to ſpeak ſome words in praiſe of thoſe goodly Buttocks, and that one did call them the Queens and Princeſſes of all other Buttocks, and that another wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they might never ſit on Nettles, but always on Cuſhions. To reſerve our modeſty, we will in ſome ſort decline from the cenſure of ſcrupulous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and I believe the frolick humours which are here contained ought not to give occaſion of affront to any, for the greateſt part of this book is only made to laugh. We may take unto us the liberty to rehearſe ſome of the pleaſant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures which are arrived to men of an evil life, for it is permitted us to laugh at their expence. For the reſt, all theſe debauchment are very true, and I doe give you them for ſuch, and doe ſo expreſſe them, that I may not be blamed for reciting them; Even thoſe whoſe particular deſign it is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them in a ſerious ſtile, muſt, to ſet them forth, repeat them alſo, as well as my ſelf, and I am confident that I deliver them in thoſe words, that are more capable to make men to hate them than to love them, for I proteſt I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of no actions which are contrary to Vertue, I will therefore proceed on with our Hiſtory without fear.</p>
            <p>Let us ſay then that after our Gallants had finiſhed their paſtime with this Lady, who would not ſhew her face, they would have entred into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where the other Ladies were, but they would not open the doors unto them, and the reaſon why they would not ſuffer themſelves to be ſeen, was <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59287:101"/>becauſe they ſhould not know who of them it was whom they beheld in that naked poſture in the other Chamber. Therfore they all departed without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of her at all. <hi>Francion</hi> coming down the ſtairs among the reſt, ſeeing <hi>Collinet,</hi> demanded of <hi>Raymond</hi> by what means he came into his Caſtle. <hi>Raymond</hi> made anſwer, Some of your people did bring him along with them from the vilage where you left him. He came not out of <hi>Paris</hi> in my company, ſaid <hi>Francion.</hi> His Servants then that came to wait upon him, did acquaint him, that <hi>Collinet</hi> being deprived of His company which he loved better than <hi>Cleran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> would never leave enquiring until he had found the way which he took when he came out of <hi>Paris,</hi> and by little journeys followed him till he had found him out. I will tell you, ſaid
<hi>Raymond,</hi> what a pranck he played this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Seeing <hi>Helena</hi> to alight from her Caroach, he began to walk up and down the Hall in a Majeſtick garb, as if he were a man of ſome great authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Houſe, and <hi>Helena</hi> being entred, he only putting his hand to the brim of his hat, ſaid unto her, Good Morrow, Good Morrow Madam, who is it you would ſpeak withall? She made a civil anſwer, that ſhe would ſpeak with me, and going a little further ſhe ſate down in a chair not far from him; Their diſcourſe was on ordinary ſubjects, in which <hi>Collinet</hi> did ſhew no defect of Judgement. He enquired from what place <hi>Helena</hi> came, of what Country ſhe was, if ſhe were married or not, and what Revenue yearly belonged to her houſe, and deported himſelf with ſo great a gravity, that <hi>Helena</hi> behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to be well apparalled, did take him for ſome perſonage of Honour, and although ſhe is conſtantly diſcreet and deliberate enough, ſhe durſt not lift up her eyes to behold him. But he could not long contain himſelf in theſe terms of modeſty and reaſon, he muſt ſhew his diſpoſition. And doe you come to ſee
<hi>Raimond</hi> then? ſaid he, I am very glad of it. He is one of my beſt Coſens, He gave me a good Supper laſt night when ever I came within his doors, and made me feed on the beſt green Peaſe that I ever did eat in my life. Sir, ſaid <hi>Helena,</hi> you are too generous, to love your kinred only for the poor courteſie of a Supper. Let us talk then Madam of ſomething elſe, ſaid he, Doe you love to be tumbled and laid on your Back, for on the faith of an honeſt man, you ſhall preſently be ſo, we doe all proceed from Generation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation, although we look as old as
<hi>Cato</hi> himſelf: You begin to be uncivil Sir, ſhe replyed, who would have thought you would have theſe words? Will you conteſt then? will you be obdurate to me? ſaid he. Speaking thoſe words he would have taken hold of her, to put his deſign in execution, but ſhe cryed out ſo loud, that I was enforced to come down from my Chamber to haſten to her relief. She demanded of me, if I had ſent for her to be uſed as one of the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched Women in the world? I ſuddenly appeaſed her, having told her what a diſtracted man Signior <hi>Collinet</hi> was. But my dear heart, ſaid <hi>Raymond</hi> unto <hi>Francion,</hi> Take you no care, for ſhe will not be ſo cruel to your Indear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Loves you ſhall make unto her, no more will any of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, we ſhall find them to be of a flowing diſpoſition; Let me alone to give you content, I will recompenſe you a hundred fold for the ſilver which heretofore I did take from you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion,</hi> having thanked him for his courteſie, did goe to <hi>Collinet,</hi> and ſaid unto him, that he did eſteem more highly of him, than of thoſe men who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving themſelves to be wiſe did glorifie themſelves, and yet had more vanity and folly in their Spirits than he had in his. For that, ſaid he, which is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily taken for the greateſt wiſedom in the world, is nothing elſe but folly, error, and defect of Judgement, as I can make it to appear if it were needfull: And we ourſelves who ſometimes do believe that we do wel to imploy our time in Love, and Feaſts, and Mummeries, ſhall find at laſt that we doe but deceive our ſelves, and that we are but very Fools. Sickneſſe will afflict us, the debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our Members will ſurprize us, before we can arrive to fifty years of age. <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59287:101"/>Leave off that Diſcourſe, let me beſeech you (ſaid <hi>Raymond,</hi>) I am not now in the humor to give ear unto theſe Preachments; neither do I well know if you are in the humor to make them. Having ſpoken theſe words, he departed from him, to entertain a gallant number of Gentlemen and Burgeſſes who lived thereabouts, whom he had invited unto Dinner, with ſome brave Ladies, who were a little more chaſt than thoſe that were there already, who came down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hall moſt richly attired, and <hi>Francion</hi> having whiſpered and demanded of them, Which of them it was who had ſhewed her Buttocks? did mark them all very curiouſly, to ſee which of them did bluſh, that he might diſcover her by it; but there was not one of them who had a Countenance more ſhamefac'd than another, neither did they give any anſwer at all; for ſhe of whom he did ſpeak, intreated her Companions not to diſcover her, ſo that for the preſent it was concealed from him.</p>
            <p>Not long afterwards there was covered a long Table, which immediatly was charged with ſuch a diverſity of Victuals, that it ſeemed they had taken almoſt all the Creatures of the Earth, to devour them at one Dinner. When they had ſatisfied their greateſt hunger, <hi>Raymond</hi> told every one of them, that He muſt obſerve the Laws which were inſcribed on the portal of the Door, to chaſe from them all ſhame, and reſolve to make the greateſt Debauchment that was ever heard of. Immediatly all the Caſements of the windows were ſhut, and the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains being drawn Candles were lighted; for they would not have taken ſo much pleaſure in that Courſe of life, if they had ſeen the day. Every one ſung his Song with a glaſſe in his hand, and they told ſo many merry Stories, that they would make a Volume by themſelves, if they were all particularly related. The Women having loſt their ſhame, did rehearſe alſo the moſt wanton tales that poſſibly they could remember.</p>
            <p>A Gentleman upon ſome Diſcourſe told them, That he would recite unto them one of the moſt notable ſtories in the world, and thus began, There was a Curate in our Village, who loved as well the Company of a Woman, as of his Prayer-book. I beſeech you Sir, (ſaid <hi>Raymond</hi>) that you will forbear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it, We muſt not ſpeak of thoſe People, although they do offend, It belongs to their Biſhop, and not to us to reprove them. If you detract them, you are to be excommunicated, and to be numbred amongſt the Libertins of this Age, againſt whom ſo much Warr is waged; Be not ſo raſh as to fall on that Subject. The Gentleman held his peace, and all the Company having approved his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, not to ſpeak againſt thoſe, of whom already ſo much hath been ſaid, that no more can be added, they determined with themſelves not ſo much as to think that there was a Prieſt living in the world. They found, that there were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of other Conditions of Men to be condemned, from whom the deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Age did receive their Original. It is true, that in the beginning of Hereſies all the World made the people of the Church the ſubject of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; There was no Account conceived to be witty, that had not a Prieſt in it.
<hi>Eraſmus, Rablais,</hi> the Queen of <hi>Navarr, Marot,</hi> and divers others, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted themſelves in this Conceit, and before them many
<hi>Italians.</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we muſt avow, That all this hath not the power to divert a religious Soul from the Path-way of Faith, and at that time when it was ſhewed us that our Prieſts were very wicked, it was not to conclude that our Religion was evil: So <hi>Boccace,</hi> who in his Novels did ſhew himſelf to be the Maſter of an excellent ſpirit, doth tacitly accuſe all thoſe who ſpeak of the People of the Church, which but few Men do take notice of. He informs us, that a Jew at <hi>Rome</hi> having obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the wicked life of the Prieſts and Monks, did not for all that forbear to make himſelf a Chriſtian, affirming, That he plainly perceived that our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was the beſt, becauſe it ſubſiſted, and every day did fortifie it ſelf, in ſpite of the exorbitances of the Church-men, and neceſſarily it muſt be, That God had a particular Care of the Church.
<hi>Raymond</hi> had theſe conſiderations, and <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59287:102"/>moreover he alleged, That weak ſpirits do believe all which they apprehend, without diving into the depth of Cauſes, and that to avoid Scandal, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes Good not to meddle at all with the Diſpencers of holy things; I have been my ſelf of the ſame Opinion; and you ſhall obſerve, that in all this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I do not ſo much as touch on the Prieſts at all. The Gentlemans ſtory being thus interrupted, they diſcourſed afterwards on ſeveral other Subjects.</p>
            <p>A certain Lord, who ſate near to <hi>Francion,</hi> did ſhew him <hi>Agatha,</hi> who was placed at the upper end of all the Table, and whiſpering him in the ear, did ſay unto him, Sir, Know you not the reaſon wherefore <hi>Raymond</hi> hath in that place ſeated that old Woman, who ſeems to be rather a piece of ſome old Cabanet, than a Lady of Pleaſure? He would that we ſhould give our ſelves to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Voluptuouſneſſe, and yet he ſeems thereby to withdraw us rather from Love, than to invite us to it; for he putteth that terrifying Object before all our eyes, which cannot but beget a horror and a trembling in our Spirits. It is certain, that here are other Ladies who are incomparably beautifull, and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give us pleaſures in abundance, yet nevertheleſſe he ought not to have mingled that <hi>Cumaean Sybill</hi> amongſt them. Know Sir (ſaid
<hi>Francion</hi>) that <hi>Raymond</hi> hath too noble a Spirit to do any thing that is incongruous. He doth invite us by that Object to addict our ſelves to all the pleaſures of the World. Have you not heard that the
<hi>Egyptians</hi> in their greateſt Feaſts did place the skull of a dead Man on their Table, to the end, that thinking that peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they ſhould not be to morrow amongſt the living, they ſhould endeavour themſelves to imploy their preſent time to their beſt advantage. By this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<hi>Raymond</hi> doth wiſely advertiſe us of the ſelf-ſame thing, that our ſelves and theſe young Ladies may take our full Carrier of Pleaſure, before we ſhall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive unto that age, in which there ſhall be nothing but Complaints and Griefs. I know not what carkaſſe of Death it is that
<hi>Raymond</hi> there preſent us with, ſaid the Gentleman, but ſhe eateth and drinketh more than four living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: If it be ſo with all the reſt of the dead, <hi>Pluto</hi> hath ſomething to do to feed them. If it be ſo (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) You may obſerve the reaſon which makes ſo many living unwilling to die, It is becauſe they are afraid to retire into a place where Famine reigneth.</p>
            <p>Many other Diſcourſes there were at the Table, and after all was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, <hi>Francion</hi> who had not yet the leiſure to entertain
<hi>Loretta,</hi> did now take the opportunity to court her, and to aſſure her what was the trouble of his Soul which he indured, being not able to make uſe of the opportunity which ſhe had permitted him to take. And becauſe he was not curious to enquire of her what was the obſtacle that interrupted their deſigns, ſhe forſook that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, having aſſured him that ſhe would make him recompence for the time he had loſt, and for the diſgraces he had ſuſtained, which aſſurance brought much comfort to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Raymond</hi> interpoſing himſelf, did take him aſide, and asked him, If he were not at that preſent in the higheſt degree of Contentment, having her with him whom ſo entirely he affected? That I may conceal nothing from you (ſaid he) I have more Deſires than there are Sands in the Sea, which maketh me afraid that I never ſhall have reſt. I love
<hi>Loretta</hi> well, and am glad that I have her with me; but I would delight my ſelf in the loves alſo of an infinite number of other Ladies, whom I affect as well as her ſelf. Every hour the fair <hi>Diana,</hi> the accompliſhed <hi>Flora,</hi> the attractive <hi>Beliza,</hi> the lovely
<hi>Iantha,</hi> the incomparable <hi>Marphiza,</hi> and an infinite number of other beauties, do repreſent themſelves to my Fancy, with all the delights they have, and with thoſe alſo which peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they have not. If one ſhould lock you up in a Chamber with all theſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies (ſaid
<hi>Raymond,</hi>) all that poſſible you could do, would be but enough to content but one of them. I vow unto you (ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi>) you ſpeak the Truth, but this day I would ſport my ſelf with one, and too morrow with another, and <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59287:102"/>if they found themſelves not ſatisfied with what I did, I would permit them (if they thought good of it) to ſeek out ſome one elſe who may be an aſſiſtant to them in the full fruition of their deſires.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agatha</hi> being behind him did liſten to this Diſcourſe, and interrupting him, ſhe ſaid, Ah Brave young Man! You are of a good and commendable diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I perceive well enough that if all the World were of your temper, we ſhould not know what Marriage is, and ſhould never be obliged to obſerve that Law. You ſay true (ſaid
<hi>Francion,</hi>) There is nothing that doth bring more bondage to us than that Injurious Knot, and Honor the cruel Tyrant to our Deſires. If we have a handſom Wife ſhe will be courted by all the World, and who can hinder it? The Common People, who are infinitely ſuſpitious, and will take hold on the leaſt apparences, will report me to be a Cuckold, and will affront me with a thouſand Injuries, although my Wife be a vertuous Woman; for if they behold any to talk with her in the Street, they'l believe that ſhe will take a greater liberty when ſhe is in her own Houſe: On the contrary, if to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew this Evil, I ſhould marry an ill-favoured Wife, thinking to avoid one Gulf, I do fall into another that is more dangerous, I ſhould never have any reſt, or joy. He is driven to deſpair who hath alwayes a Fury for his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in his Bed, and at his Table. It is farr beter that we were all free. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out joyning in Marriage we ſhould joyn our ſelves with thoſe whom we like beſt; and when we are weary of one, it ſhould be permitted to us to go unto another. If a Woman ſtood affected to me, ſhe ſhould for all that, if ſhe had a mind thereunto, proſtitute her ſelf to another, and although peradventure it was brought unto my knowledge, yet I ſhould not be offended at it; for the <hi>Chimera's</hi> of Honour ſhould not be lodged in our Brains; and it ſhould not be forbidden us to goe and to Court the Miſtreſſes of others. There would be none but Baſtards in the world, and by conſequence we ſhould ſee none but moſt gallant Men. All thoſe who have performed extraordinary atchievments, and tranſcended the Vulgar, all thoſe whom Antiquity hath called Heroes, were Baſtards. In this number was <hi>Hercules, Theſeus, Romulus, Alexander,</hi> and divers others. You will repreſent unto me, that if all Women were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as in <hi>Cato</hi>'s Commonwealth, one could not tell to whom the Children did belong which were begotten; But of what Importance is that? <hi>Lauretta</hi> who doth not know who was her Father, nor who was her Mother, and who trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles not her head to enquire after them, Is ſhe any thing the worſe for it, if ſhe be not the ſame, as a vain Curioſity may perſwade her that ſhe is not? Now in this Caſe this Curioſity would be to no purpoſe, and none but unreaſonable perſons would deſire the knowledge of that which is either impoſſible, or of no Importance: Nay, this would be a Cauſe of a tranſcendent Good; for thereby we ſhould be inforced to aboliſh all Preheminence, and all Nobility; Every one ſhould be equal to another, and the Fruits of the Earth ſhould be common to us all. The Laws of Nature ſhould be had only in reverence, and every one ſhould live as in the golden Age. There are many other things to be ſpoken on this Argument, but I reſerve them to another time.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Francion</hi> had ſpoke theſe words, whether in earneſt or in jeſt it is uncertain, yet ſure it is, that <hi>Raymond</hi> and <hi>Agatha</hi> did approve his Reaſons; and told him, That for this time he muſt he contented to delight himſelf only with the Pleaſures of
<hi>Loretta.</hi> He made anſwer, That accordingly he would endeavour to content himſelf. In this Diſcourſe they were when the Muſick entred into the Hall, who played all manner of Dances. All the fair Women of the Cities and Villages thereabouts were come then into the Caſtle, with ſome young Gentlewomen who were accompliſhed with all perfections, and there were ſome Gentlemen with them who could Dance very well. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, the Galliards, the Currantoes and Lavoltoes, did warm the wanton ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites of them all. On every ſide there was nothing ſeen but kiſſes &amp; embraces,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59287:103"/>&amp; when Night was come, the Table was covered with a magnificent Collation, more gratefull than a Supper; For in the firſt Courſe there were ſerved in moſt exquiſite Viands, with which thoſe that were hungry might repleniſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. There were ſuch an abundance of Confects of all ſorts, that every one having filled both their Bellies and their Pockets, there ſtill remained a great quantity, with which they made a ſweet Warre, throwing them at one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on every ſide. The Drums, the Trumpets, and the Hoboys did then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſound aloud in the Court, and the Viols played in a place near unto the Hall, and with the Voyces of the Aſſiſtants made an Incomparable Muſick. The Confuſion was ſo great and pleaſant, that I know not how to repreſent it to you. It were a hard task to number the Virgins who that night loſt their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denheads, or the Husbands that were made Cuckolds. In the tumult of ſo great an Aſſembly (which hindred that thoſe who did go away could not be ſeen) many eſcaped with their Miſtreſſes to content their deſires in ſome more private place. There were ſome Women who had appointed their Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearts to meet in that very place, it being the moſt convenient they could chuſe, and where they could not be in thoſe dangers which they feared in their own houſes. <hi>Raymond,</hi> who deſired that his Houſe might be entirely conſecrated to Love, did give command that the greateſt part of the Chambers ſhould be ready furniſhed, and left open to ſerve as a Refuge to the Lovers. They were well prepared to entertain them. The four Knights and their Ladies did for their parts never ſtirr out of the Hall, having leiſure enough in another hour to take their delights by themſelves. The others made uſe of every place, and took their adventures with their Loves on one ſide and on the other, exerciſing themſelves in an infinite number of Pleaſures. <hi>Francion</hi> handled all the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men he did meet with as he pleaſed himſelf. He took one of the ſix Ladies of the Caſtle, who was called <hi>Tereſia,</hi> and having laid her all along on the Form, on the end whereof there was a great Candle burning, he truſſed up her Petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat behind, and kiſſed her Buttocks, on which there was a little black Mole, which he no ſooner perceived, but he laughing ſaid, Ha, ha, ha <hi>Tereſia,</hi> You have carried it very cunningly. It is you whom this morning we ſaw na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. The Mark which you have doth cauſe me to know you. Immediatly he did go to proclaim it to all the world, in what manner he had found out the Buttocks to which that Morning they did homage, and every one laughed heartily at it. <hi>Pereſia,</hi> who ſeemed not to be much ſtartled at it (in a bold humor, and ſuch a one as belonged to the place wherein ſhe was) did ſay unto all the Men there preſent, And what of all this? You have ſeen my Poſteriors? Have you a mind to ſee them again? I ſhall not be ſo bard-hearted as to deny you the ſight of them. Who deſerveth moſt worthily to be laugh'd at, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you, or I? I only ſhewed them by force, but you kiſſed them of your own accord.</p>
            <p>Having left off this Diſcourſe, <hi>Raymond,</hi> who loved a life to fight with the glaſſe, did cauſe the moſt luſty Wines to be drawn and brought forth, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome good Companions, who did defie the ſtrength thereof. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (ſaid he) that is comparable to this Drink, it fills thoſe with a certain Divinity who drink deeply of it. It doth drive away all fearfull Impreſſions which Error and Ignorance had brought upon us. It is by this power that the Orator in his Orations feareth not to ſpeak home to his Auditory, and that a Lover with boldneſſe diſcovers his Malady to her who is the Cauſe thereof. Victory is ordinarily purchaſed by thoſe Souldiers whom this VVine doth ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der valiant. Drink then, Drink deeply, and let us wiſh to die as <hi>George</hi> Duke of
<hi>Clarence,</hi> who by the ſentence of the King of <hi>England</hi> being conſtrained to loſe his life, did cauſe himſelf to be put into a Pipe of wine, of which he did drink ſo much that he did burſt again. Come to it,
<hi>Francion,</hi> and take thy fill, ſaid <hi>Raymond. Francion</hi> made anſwer, I am but a bungler at Drinking, I had <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59287:103"/>rather imploy my ſtrength in ſporting with <hi>Loretta</hi> than with
<hi>Bacchus.</hi> If I drink too much, any whole Body will be ſo brutiſhly beſotted, that I can take on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but a faint pleaſure with Women, I had almoſt ſaid a dolorous one. Well, well, ſaid <hi>Raymond,</hi> Every man is free here to drink what he pleaſeth; Follow that pleaſure which is moſt agreeable unto you.</p>
            <p>The Muſicians then did ſing many new Aires, joyning the ſound of their Lutes and Viols to that of their voices. Ah, ſaid
<hi>Francion,</hi> leaning his head on the breaſt of <hi>Loretta.</hi> after the view of an excellent beauty, there is no other pleaſure can ſo much inchant me, as that of Muſick, my heart leaps at every accent, and me thinks I am no more my ſelf. The tremblings of the voice doe make my Soul deliciouſly to tremble alſo; for my Nature is conſtantly inclined in motion, I am always in a pleaſing agitation. My ſpirit and my Body do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways tremble at every little ſhaking, you may eaſily behold the proof of it, for with ſome difficultie I doe now hold this glaſſe in my hand, I have ſuch a trembling all over me. That which I can play beſt upon the Lute are but trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings. I touch not your fair breſt but with a kind of trembling;<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My Soveraign pleaſure is the wanton motion, yet me thinks, I am all Divine, I would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in motion like the Heavens. Having ſpoke thoſe words, he took a Lute from one of the Muſicians, and the Ladies deſiring him to ſhew his skill there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he began to touch it, and at the ſame time did ſing an Air, the ditty whereof I care not if I do here inſert. And I am ſo true an Hiſtorian, that I know not what ſhould withold me from giving you the Note alſo, that ſo I may forget no circumſtance, and the Reader may have a thorough knowledge of it. This will not be difficult unto me to doe, for I have inſerted no verſes in this Book, which have not ſome Air or other to attend them; and I doe not herein as thoſe men, who inſtead of Sonnets doe give you Songs, without knowing whether they ought to be ſung or not; you may aſſure your ſelf, if men would put the prick Song, and the tablature of the Lute in their Romances with the Songs which there they find, it would be an invention to make them ſell as well, as the Pictures doe the Books, with which the Stationers now a days do imbelliſh their Title-pages, to render them the more merchandable. But without examining what Fancy hath poſſeſſed me to give a Rule to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, content your ſelves at this preſent with the words only of
<hi>Francions</hi> Song, and gueſſe by the cadence at the Air thereof.</p>

            <p>This Song which the Muſicians played upon their Lutes, after that <hi>Francion</hi> had recited one couplet of the verſes, did raviſh the Spirits of all the ſtanders by, the cadence was ſo taking, and ſo ſoftly wanton, that with the words to which it was ſet, it invited all the world to the pleaſures of Love. All who were in the Hall breathed forth their Souls after the charms of pleaſure. The lights alſo at that time being moved, I know not by what wanton Air, did ſeem to breath like the men, and to be poſſeſſed with ſome paſſionate deſire. A ſweet Fury having ſeized upon their Souls they played the Sarabands, which the greateſt part danced confuſedly, intermingling diverſe wanton and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king poſtures.</p>
            <p>Some Ladies who hitherto had preſerved their honour, did now abandon it, conforming themſelves to others who were examples to them;
<hi>Raymond</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left off drinking, which held him ſome hours, did now addreſſe himſelf to the Women, and in his entertainment of them he uſed ſuch coarſe words, that I cannot otherwiſe expreſſe them, but according to the vulgar, that is in down right language. <hi>Francion</hi> obſerving it, ſaid unto him, Sir, Upon my Faith I muſt blame you, and all thoſe who have ſuch words in their mouths; Wherefore ſo, my dear Friend, ſaid <hi>Raymond,</hi> Is there any hurt to aſſume the boldneſſe to ſpeak of thoſe things which we are ſo bold to act? Doe you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that thing to be ſo reverend and venerable, that we ought not ſo much as to ſpeak of it? That is not it, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> you may talk of it freely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and name it without ſcandal, but I would have it in more cleanly terms than thoſe which you expreſſe. It is manifeſt that brave men when they would teſtifie their gallantry, doe make choice of the moſt excellent words <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59287:104"/>they can collect, and uſe not ſuch which are the proper expreſſions of Porters, Lackeys, and all the Offalls of the world, who have no other words at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; For my ſelf, It doth much incenſe me, when ſometimes I do perceive a Poet doth believe he hath made a good Copy of Verſes, when it is made odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with ſuch filthy words. The greateſt part of thoſe Men who have publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the new Collection of the
<hi>French</hi> Poets, are much to be condemned for it; and moreover they have in that Book printed ſuch fooliſh Songs, that they are fit for none but
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>apſters in Tipling houſes, and the black-Guard in the <hi>Louvre.</hi> They ſhow to all the world the infamous Verſes which they have compoſed; wherein there is nothing remarkable, but that they bluntly name thoſe natural acts and parts of our Body, which Ingenuity would have cloathed with cleaner Language; Nevertheleſſe, the Spirits of the Ignorant are moſt moved to laughter at ſuch broad expreſſions; And are theſe, do you think, fit Ornaments for Poeſie? I doe deſire that ſuch Men as we are ſhould ſpeak in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to render our ſelves different from the Vulgar, and that we ſhould invent ſome decent words for thoſe things, of which we doe delight ſo often to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. On my Faith, and good reaſon have you for it (ſaid
<hi>Raymond</hi>) but tell me, Do not we make love in the ſame manner as the pooreſt Peaſants? Why then ſhall we uſe Expreſſions that are different from theirs? You deceive your ſelf, (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) we make love in another manner, we uſe a nobler familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than thoſe who have only a deſire to glut their ſtupid appetit, in which they do not differ at all from Beaſts; for they make love but with their Bodies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but we make love with our Souls and Bodies both together. Obſerve how I play the Philoſopher on this ſubject. You will tell me, that all our Courtly Poſtures and Indearments are to no purpoſe, and that they all tend to the ſame end. I will acknowledge it, there is nothing more true. You will then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, I have my Deſire; for by conſequence we ought then to ſpeak in the ſame words as they, of that thing. Obſerve what I ſhall ſay more, Although they have the ſame Parts of Body, and the ſame Organs of Speech as we have; for in their Diſcourſe they do move their tongues, they open their mouths, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock their teeth as we do; yet they have not thoſe attractions, and tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Spirit: For in the Sport of Love, although our bodies have the ſame action with theirs, yet our Spirits are farr above theirs, and carry with them that inward love and ſweetneſſe, of which they are not capable; we ſhould therefore uſe other terms than they doe; for the diſtinction is, and ought to be, That in our loves we have ſomething divine and celeſtial; but their Love is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together terreſtrial and ſenſual.</p>
            <p>Every one admired at this ſubtil argument of <hi>Francion,</hi> which (no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Logicians) hath not its Second in the world. The Women did principally approve his Reaſons, becauſe they would have been very glad to have new words to expreſſe thoſe things which they loved beſt, to the end, that leaving the old words, which ſound not civilly in their mouthes, they might ſpeak freely of all, without fear of being blamed, becauſe the iniquity and corruption of the world could not ſo ſoon make this New Language o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion</hi> was then intreated to give names of his own Invention, to all thoſe things which he ſhould find not well named; and the better to invite him to it, they told him, It would make his Name to fly over all <hi>France,</hi> and render him more famous than already he was; for every one would be ſtudious to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after the Author of theſe Novelties, of which they would never ſpeak without making mention of him. <hi>Francion</hi> for the preſent did excuſe himſelf, and ſaid, That ere it were long he would adviſe with ſome of his moſt knowing Friends about it, to be thoroughly reſolved of it. Moreover he did ſwear, that when ever he had leiſure he would compoſe a Book of the Practiſe of the moſt pleaſant Sports of Love.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59287:105"/>This Entertainment being ended, many Gentlemen and Ladies who deſired not to lie that Night in <hi>Raymonds</hi> Caſtle, did take their leave of him, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their own houſes: Thoſe who ſtayed behind, retired not long afterwards two by two into the Chambers that were left open for them. <hi>Francion</hi> was with
<hi>Lauretta,</hi> and <hi>Raymond</hi> with <hi>Helena,</hi> and the others with thoſe who did beſt pleaſe them; I will not undertake to give you an account in this place of their infinite pleaſures, It is a task beyond my ability.</p>
            <p>The next day, and ſix days following, they imployed themſelves in all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights that could be imagined. But <hi>Francion</hi> having conſidered with himſelf, that if he were deprived of the Company of
<hi>Lauretta,</hi> the Pourtraict of <hi>Nays</hi> which <hi>Raymond</hi> had ſhewed him, would throw his reſtleſſe Spirit into a new unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he reſolved with himſelf to enquire of <hi>Dorini</hi> after her; and whether that moſt accompliſhed piece were a Fancy of the Painter, or an Imitation of ſome other work of Nature? <hi>Dorini</hi> did ſatisfie him that it was the Pourtraict of one of the moſt beautifull Ladies of all <hi>Italy,</hi> who was yet living; and thus he purſued his Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>In the Confines of <hi>Romania</hi> there is a young Lady called
<hi>Nays,</hi> the Relict of a brave Marqueſſe, to whom ſhe was married but ſix moneths, ſhe hath lived a Widdowed life a year, and more. You may imagine that her perfections and riches have procured her Servants enough. She hath ſo great a number of them, that it may be ſaid, ſhe can both ſell, lend, and give, and yet not one of all thoſe who court her, can obtain of her any remarkable favour. Amongſt all the <hi>Italians,</hi> there is not any, but only her deceaſed Husband, whom ſhe could love. Her Inclination doth lead her to love the <hi>French,</hi> inſomuch that having ſeen the Picture of a young Gentleman of this Country named <hi>Floriander,</hi> a Man of an excellent Feature and Complexion, ſhe was ſo paſſionately in love with it, as if ſhe had ſeen not his Picture, but him himſelf, becauſe ſhe had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard a large reherſal of his Vertue. To find a remedy for her grief, ſhe freely diſcovered her ſelf to me, as to her Kinſman, and aſſured Friend. I did comfort her the beſt I could, and did put her into good hopes, and ſhe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Counſel, cauſed that Picture to be drawn which you have ſeen, that it might be ſent to <hi>Floriander,</hi> to invite him to take the pains to come unto her, and court her in the way of Marriage. I had a long time a deſire to ſee this Kingdom of
<hi>France,</hi> which was the reaſon that I freely offered my ſelf to ſerve her in this affair, where no man could better aſſiſt her than my ſelf. After my arrival to the Court, I attained to the knowledge of this Gentleman, whom I found to be of a ſweet diſpoſition, and moſt inclinable to Love, which aſſured me that I ſhould eaſily gain his good-will for <hi>Nays.</hi> I was once determined to acquaint him with her Riches, and the Nobility of her Birth, having firſt ſhewed him her Beauty, and to aſſure him of the great affection ſhe did bear unto him, for all her great diſtance from him; But I altered a little that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, ſeeing that he began to be indiſpoſed in his health, for which the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians counſelled him to drink of certain Waters which are in a Village not far from our Country. I did write word to my Kinſwoman that ſhe ſhould take ſome occaſion to come thither, and not loſe that opportunity to draw him into her Nets. I doe not well know if ſhe were there in expectation of him, or not, but if ſhe were, ſhe hath loſt her labour; for <hi>Floriander</hi> is ſince dead. I have wrote her word of it, but cannot tell whether ſhe hath received the Letter or not, or whether ſhe is come from her own Houſe to give him a Meeting at the Waters. I will return unto her with all the ſpeed I can, to comfort her in her afflictions. Ah! ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> I dare aſſure you Sir, I will wait upon her in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place whereſoever ſhe may be found: ſo rare a Beauty doth deſerve a journy of many moneths, to obtain but a ſight of her. I have alwayes been in love with beautifull Ladies whereſoever I have ſeen them; nay, I have been in love with thoſe alſo whom only I have heard reported to be lovely; I will not now <pb n="16" facs="tcp:59287:105"/>derogate from my commendable cuſtome. Moreover, I for a long time have had a deſire to ſee <hi>Italy,</hi> that fair Garden of the world, I ſhall now find a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py occaſion to invite me to it. In the firſt place I will have recourſe unto the waters to meet with
<hi>Nays</hi> there, and will not you <hi>Dorini</hi> be pleaſed to take the pains to goe along with me? If you deſire, ſaid <hi>Dorini,</hi> to incounter with <hi>Nays</hi> at the Bathes, you muſt be gone in the morning betimes, and uſe all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible diligence; For my own part, I have a deſire to ſtay a moneth or two with Count <hi>Raymond,</hi> for the accompliſhing of ſome deſign I have in hand, you muſt therefore excuſe me that I cannot keep you Company, but I doubt not but that on my return I ſhall find you at <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Nays,</hi> who cannot but be ſurprized with your merits and your perſon, as ſoon as ever ſhe ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold you; And were it not that ſhe ſtill keepeth by her the pourtract of her deceaſed Lover, I would adviſe you for a few days at your firſt accoſting of her, to take his name upon you. <hi>Francion</hi> replyed, I cannot ſuddenly reſolve upon that; for it ſeems to me, that ſhould I take upon my ſelf the name of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon, it were to confeſſe that I had nothing commendable in my ſelf at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Raymond</hi> hearing his reſolution, ſaid, that he would travell alſo into <hi>Italy,</hi> being weary of <hi>France,</hi> and of the perpetual troubles of the Court, but ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions for certain days retaining him, he determined to take <hi>Dorini</hi> with him as an aſſociate in his Journey.</p>
            <p>The Journey being in this manner reſolved upon,
<hi>Francion</hi> immediatly gave charge to one of <hi>Raymonds</hi> Servants to carry back <hi>Collinet</hi> to <hi>Clerantes,</hi> and by his letter to acquaint him, that he was determined for a little while to ſolace himſelf in other Countries, according to thoſe deſires which <hi>Clerantes</hi> had often heard him to expreſſe. He did write alſo to his Mother to poſſeſſe her with the reſolution he had taken.</p>
            <p>Some who were with him demanded of him, if it were no grief unto him to be deprived of the Company of <hi>Lauretta?</hi> to which he made anſwer, that the prey was now at his own mercy, and that he had ſported himſelf with her as much as poſſibly he deſired, and therefore he muſt look after ſome new game. As they were in this diſcourſe, they beheld from one of the Chamber windows an old man to enter into the Court of the Caſtle, being mounted on a lean mare, and unſerviceable for that labour to which in the vigour of her youth ſhe was accuſtomed. He who was mounted on her was cloathed in a black Cloak, which with a point was faſtned about his Collar, he had an old ſword by his ſide. This honourable perſonage was <hi>Valentine,</hi> who obſerving that his wife ſtayed ſo long in her pilgrimage, did not well know what to think of it, and had been in ſeveral places to look for her, until one who belonged unto <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> had informed him that he had ſeen her in his Caſtle.</p>
            <p>He no ſooner entred into the Court, but he ſaw
<hi>Lauretta,</hi> who ſate in the portall of the Door with
<hi>Tereſia;</hi> Immediatly he alighted from his horſe, but it was not without much difficulty and trouble to him; His wife perceiving him, took her Companion by the hand, and going up the ſtairs did lock her ſelf up in one of the Chambers. He being overcome with fury, did purſue her to the bottom of the ſtairs, and eſpying in the way the effigies of a Lady made in wood, he began thus to vomit forth his choler againſt it. What a Devil doſt thou mean? Is this the pilgrimage thou haſt made? Bitch as thou art, I have been told of the good life which here thou leadeſt; I ſhall catch thee at home again, I ſhall; I will tye thee up then, and puniſh thee as thou deſerveſt; Here thou haſt the filthy fill of thy pleaſures with men, I doe perſwade my ſelf that there is not a Horſe-keeper in all this houſe, who hath not made it his buſineſſe to have played at
<hi>paſſage</hi> on the Belly. Hereafter, for all thy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance now, I ſhall make thee ſtarve for it, and thou ſhalt not receive of my ſelf ſo much as thy ordinary pittance. Marry come up, Thou art the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59287:106"/>cauſe that I am no more reſpected; I am every where called <hi>Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l</hi> and
<hi>Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb,</hi> and told I have not ſpirit enough to bridle thy appetites; To be ſhort, I am altogether diſhonoured by thee; O good God! what an injuſtice is it that the honour of a husband ſhould depend upon that which is under the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pron of his wife, but thou ſhalt pay for that broken veſſail of thine, I dare aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Raymond</hi> and others who heard him make ſuch a noiſe, did approach unto him, and obſerving that <hi>Lauretta</hi> had wiſely withdrawn her ſelf, and that no anſwer at all was returned unto his cholerick complaints, they did aſſure him that ſhe was not in the Caſtle, and that he was deluded by an apparition. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they prevailed ſo far upon him, that they brought him to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt part of the Garden, to make themſelves more merry with him, and then drowned his melancholy in many glaſſes of Wine. You are to obſerve, that all the while he was the ſubject of their ſport in the garden, and when he was drinking in the Cellar, he did put off neither his Cloak nor his Sword. He conceived he ought not to diſarm himſelf, but was to retain a greater ſhew of ſtate and gravity before the Nobility that was preſent. It was a moſt pleaſant ſpectacle to behold him in this equipage, for he had put on his ſcarf in which he carried his Sword, as if it had been a Collar of <hi>SS.</hi> and had forgot to paſſe it under his left arm, inſomuch that his Sword would be playing always before him, and did much diſeaſe him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He did nothing elſe but put by his Sword on the one ſide, and his Cloak on the other, which did as much incumber him.</p>
            <p>Having ended his large draught, his ſpurs interfering and ſtriking againſt one another, he ſtumbled at every ſtep, and it was a hazzard that he was not beheld every moment to fall on the ground. It was the courteſie of <hi>Raymond</hi> to bring him back to the Caſtle, but he returned not with ſo much eaſe as he did ſet forward, becauſe he had drunk too deep. When he came to the door he could goe no further, his Sword which did hang at random about his neck, did hit againſt both the poſts of the Entry, ſo that he was ſtopped, as it had been with a Bar, ſometimes he would draw backwards, and ſometimes thruſt forward with all the ſtrength he had, but all that he could doe was but to make his ſword to yield and bend a little; O, ſaid he, I believe there is ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment here, I cannot move one foot further. The Gentlemen who heard him, received an incomparable pleaſure, and did let him alone, but his Sword at laſt falling off to one ſide, the paſſage was open for him, and he followed thoſe that did go in before him; To excuſe himſelf, he ſaid unto them, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, You ſee that I am no great Warrier, I mean no harm by carrying this cold Iron about me; when I came out of Doors my Maid did help me to put it on, ſhe knew how to do it better than my ſelf. Theſe Spurs which you ſee, were in my Corn-loft quite covered with ruſt and chaff, inſtead of buckling them to my heels, I had faſtned them to my toes, which ſeemed to me to be far more proper, although my Maid told me, It was not the faſhion ſo to wear them; Why ſo? replyed I, When I give you or any one elſe a kick, Do I not ſpurn at you forward with my foot? They are Horſes who do kick backward; For my own part I have no ſtrength at all in my heel, Can I not ſpurr my horſe better having my
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eet armed rather than my heel? For all theſe Reaſons, or what ever other I could allege, my Maid hath put them on in the ſame manner as you behold; if ſhe hath done well in it, I refer my ſelf to you: For the reſt of my habiliments, I did put them on my ſelf, as it pleaſed Fortune.</p>
            <p>The honeſt <hi>Gaul</hi> having made this pleaſant Diſcourſe, was conducted into the Hall, where he was yet a little longer entertained; becauſe that <hi>Francion</hi> being to give his Farewell to
<hi>Lauretta,</hi> had in the mean time commanded the Coachman to harneſſe ſix horſes, and to bring them to the Caroach with all ſpeed, to carry back <hi>Lauretta</hi> to her own houſe with <hi>Agatha,</hi> that her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band might find her at home on his Return. <hi>Valentin</hi> having taken his leave <pb n="18" facs="tcp:59287:106"/>of the Company, did take horſe, and did not meet with the Caroach on the way; becauſe either his Imployment, or the exceſſe of Wine he had taken, did ſteer him in another courſe. On his return he found his fair Wiſe in bed, who counterfeited her ſelf to be ſick. He having told her, That he had been abroad three days to enquire what was become of her, She aſſured him, that it was above two days ſince ſhe returned; ſo that by this excuſe ſhe appeaſed his choler, and he verily believed that he did not ſee her at all in the Caſtle of
<hi>Raymond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this while <hi>Francion</hi> made preparations for his departure, having teſtified the great grief he entertained, being for ſome time to be deprived of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Raymond.</hi> On the next morning he took his leave of him very early, and departed with all his train, which by the aſſiſtance of his good Friend he had increaſed, by the addition of one Groom of his Chamber, three Lackeys, and a Horſe-keeper.</p>
            <p>When he came to the Innes wherein he was to lodge, he entertained himſelf with no other thought, but only with the contemplation of her who was the Cauſe of his voyage. Being oftentimes in the way, he would take her Picture out of his Pocket, and could not forbear to look upon it as he did ride. Every hour he rendred homage to it, and offered the ſacrifice of an infinite number of ſighs and tears. On the firſt day of his travel there arived no Adventure at all; but on the ſecond there did fall out one which deſerveth to be recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>About Mid-day he came into a Village where he determined to alight, and to refreſh himſelf, to which purpoſe he made choice of the beſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and whiles they were walking his Horſes, and putting them into the Stable, he did go into the Kitchin himſelf, to enquire what there was ready to eat; he found the Houſe ſufficiently provided with all things that might ſatisfy hunger, but he could not find any one to give any anſwer to him; only he heard a great noiſe in the Chamber above the Kitchin, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what the buſineſſe was, he did immediatly go up the ſtairs. The Door being open, he beheld a Man upon the Bed, who was covered only with one ſheet, and uttered himſelf in a thouſand coutumelious words to a Woman who did not ſit farr off upon a Coffer His Choler was ſo great, that at that inſtant he was riſing up ſtark naked to beat his Wife with a ſtaff which was hard by him. <hi>Francion,</hi> who did not underſtand if the occaſion of his Rage were juſt, or not, did ſtop him, and cauſed him to return unto his Bed. Oh Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur (ſaid the Man unto him) Be pleaſed to aſſiſt me againſt my Enemies! I have a Wife worſe than any Dragon, ſhe is ſo wicked, that ſhe dares to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her whoredoms before my own eyes. Sir, (ſaid the Wife) making a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy to
<hi>Francion,</hi> Let us depart from this place I beſeech you, with all the ſpeed we can, I am poſſeſſed with ſo great a fear, that I dare not ſtay any longer. It is not my Husband that ſpeaketh now, but an evil Spirit that is entred into his Body, and uſurpeth there the place of his Soul, which is departed above 6 hours ago. Ah! (ſaid the Husband) Was the like Villany ever known? She would make me to believe that I am dead, to the end that ſhe might enjoy my Goods, and the Company of that Man, with whom ſhe leads a wicked and a wanton life. At that inſtant there came out of the next Chamber a handſom young Fellow, and an antient Woman, who both of them very reſolutely declared, That the Taverner was dead, and that they ought to ſee him buried. How now Sirrah, (ſaid he) to the Young-man; Sirrah, you are as much dead as I am, Get you out of ſight, I ſhall live long enough, I hope, to ſee you hang'd; Sirrah, Thou ſhalt be puniſhed I dare aſſure thee; Thou haſt committed a greater fault than if thou hadſt attempted with a knife to cut my throat; for thou wouldſt have me buried me alive: Moreover thou art an Adulterer, and haſt polluted my Bed with yonder She wolf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:59287:107"/>This Diſpute ſeeming very ſtrange to
<hi>Francion,</hi> he deſired to underſtand the Original and Ground of the Complaint, and cauſing them to hold their peace, who began to cry out and make a great noiſe, he deſired the Taver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to give him a full account of the whole Story; whereupon he thus ſpake unto him.</p>
            <p>Sir, It is now three years ſince I have been married to that She Devil whom you ſee, It had been farre better for me to have been put into a Sack, and thrown into the River; for ever ſince I have lived with her, I have not enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one Minute of Reſt. She will ordinarily make quarrels with me for things of no moment, and will ſcold ſo loud, that not long ſince being unwilling to to goe out of Doors, by reaſon of the great Rain that fell, I was conſtrained to ſtop my ears with black wool, and I know not well what Napkin I did wind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my head, to the end, that at the leaſt I might not hear her, becauſe I was reſolved not to go forth. As ſoon as ſhe perceived my Intention, ſhe determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with her ſelf that I ſhould hear every word ſhe ſpake, and throwing her ſelf upon my Bed, ſhe ceaſed not untill ſhe had pull'd off my Biggin, and then putting her mouth to my ear ſhe cried out ſo loud, that eight days after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I was quite deaf. But all this is nothing. Obſerve how brazen-fac'd ſhe is! She ſaw me once ſpeak to a young Maid of this Town, immediatly ſhe gave a bad apprehenſion to it, and taking a knife in her hand, when ſhe was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Bed, ſhe ſaid, That by the grace of God ſhe would geld me, to hinder me from going to any other but her ſelf. I was at that time in a patient and a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant humor, and ſmiling, ſaid unto her, Do nothing (Sweet-heart) in the firſt heat of your choler; the Time may come that you dearly will repent it. She made anſwer to me, Villain, Do you take no care for that, I will have nothing any more to do with you, I can have Men enough, and thoſe that are far more luſty than your ſelf. Tell me (Sir) If you did ever hear of the like Impudence? Nevertheleſſe I did forbear to ſtrike her at that time; and I do verily believe, that if her Choler had not been appeaſed, I had ſuffered the diſgrace to have been gelded by her. Her threatnings (which oftentimes ſhe made unto me, to provide her ſelf with a Sweet-heart) were put in Execution, She made choice of this young Fellow to ſerve her in a Corner. But, good God! Was there ever miſery like to mine? My wife is the moſt precious Fool in the world, when other Lovers are accuſtomed to give ſomething to their Sweet-hearts, this fellow is ſo beggarly, that my Wife makes many preſents to him; to pay him for the pleaſure which he receiveth of her, She gives him wherewith to feed him, and to cloath him; I often have obſerved my cloaths on his back, and if there be in my Kitchin any thing better than other, which I reſerve for my Gueſts, this Gallant wil hang a noſe after it; and I muſt allow him wages for ſtopping my Wifes Gap, I muſt pay him as if he were one of the Labourers, who comes hither, either by the day, or by the week, to perform ſome neceſſary imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about my houſe; After I had harboured a ſuſpition that he looked too familiarly on my wife, I indeavoured to make my felf ſure of it; and counterfeiting that I was to travel many miles into the Country, I ſecretly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned at my back door, and underſtanding that they were both together in the next room, I privatly conveyed my ſelf into the Houſe of office that joyns unto it. I heard very well the greateſt part of their diſcourſe, which by little and little did render it ſelf more amorous, and I muſt confeſſe did grievouſly diſpleaſe me; I would moſt willingly have heard it all, to be more fully ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but there arrived to me a great misfortune, for a Defluction which fell upon my Lungs did make me very rheumatick, and I coughed ſo extremely, as if I had ſwallowed a bag full of feathers, Howſoever ſo great was my deſire to liſten to them, that I knew not how to diſpoſe of my ſelf, but only to hold my Breath as long as poſſibly I could; At the laſt I concluded that my beſt courſe was to put my head down into the Privy to cough within the hole, that <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59287:107"/>ſo I might not be perceived, which when accordingly I had done, I coughed above eight times from the bottom of my ſtomack, which did me much good, and I enforced my ſelf to cough as much again, to bring forth my flegm all at once, for I was extremely flegmatick; And I muſt tell you by the way, that I took much pleaſure in it, for my voice reſounded in that ſubterranean place, and although my flegm did fall ſoft enough, yet my voice made an Eccho, which might be heard as plain as is the Eccho near the mountain a quarter of a league from this place; But (O unhappy accident) when I thought to have drawn my head out of the hole, It was impoſſible, I did thruſt it in with all the force I had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I had not the way to get it out, as I had to put it in, for my chin as a hook did hinder the coming forth of it, and I was as it were in the Pillory. Ha, if any one had then come in, he might have done me miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief enough, before I had been able to have defended my ſelf. It would be a good invention in ſuch a place to put reſiſting malefactors, when they are to indure the whip. I did uſe all the force I had, but inſtead of drawing forth my head, my indeavours were ſo great, that I plucked the ſeat out of its place, for the bord was old and half broken before. In this manner I became half Maſter of my liberty, and was no longer conſtrained to be obliged unto one place; nevertheleſſe I carryed my priſon about with me; I endeavoured with my hands to pluck the plank from my neck, but I was not able to effect it, and I could not but laugh to ſee my ſelf thus attired in the new faſhion, with a Spaniſh Ruff about my Neck. Howſoever I was afraid, that if my Wife had found me in this condition, ſhe would have made ſome ſport with me. Seeing therefore that I could not deliver my ſelf, my deſire was as privatly as I could to have recourſe unto my old Companion the Sawyer, who lived at the upper end of our ſtreet, to requeſt him to ſaw it off; but it ſo fortuned, that in the Street I met with many, both young and old, who did run after me as after a Fool, and would not forſake me until I came to the place whither I was to go. There it was that I was delivered of my unſavoury yoak, but it was noyſed over all the Country, for the Sawyer my Companion could not hold his peace, and the Boys in the ſtreet doe yet laugh at me whereſoever I goe; But that which moſt afflicted me, was, that I did not thoroughly underſtand the end of the diſcourſe of the young Ribauld in my houſe, and I could not know whether he had made me a Cuckold or no. But not long afterwards I was too ſenſibly aſſured of it, for returning from the fields, I found him with his unſatisfied Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the act of their uncleaneſſe. God knows, what a broken heart I had, I ſtayed my Ruffian as he was going forth, and ſaid unto him, Tell me thou Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, what wert thou a doing within? Have a care that I take thee ſo no more, for if I doe, I will mince thee into leſſe pieces than meat is for the Pye. I know well enough that thou cameſt to ſee my Wife; Doſt thou think that thou canſt content her better than my ſelf? Well, well, let us make tryal upon this ſeat who is better provided by Nature to pleaſe a Woman, thou or my ſelf; Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe words, I produced, and ſhewed him what were the gifts of Nature which I had, but he durſt not doe the like, knowing that the right was not on his ſide. He departed from my houſe much aſhamed, nevertheleſſe, he hath ſince oftentimes returned, and not ſo much in private, but I have always notice of it. One day I found him lying with my wife in the ſame Bed which here you ſee. I only contented my ſelf to chide him for it, and did let him goe away ſafe and ſound. Oh what a grief it is unto me when I doe think of it; I ought to have flung his Hat out of the Window, or have torn his doublet from his back; But I was not my ſelf at the ſight of that Accident.</p>
            <p>All theſe things did ſo afflict me, that I did ſwear to that Whore, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly within the compaſſe of a year, I ſhould kill my ſelf to be delivered of thoſe torments which ſhe cauſed me to endure, yet for all that, ſhe became every day more wicked than other, deſiring nothing more than to ſee me car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <pb n="21" facs="tcp:59287:108"/>forth with my heels formoſt. We have never quarrelled ſince; but ſhe hath ſaid unto me,
<hi>Robin,</hi> What do you make account to do? Why doſt thou not perform thy Oath, wretched Fool, which thou haſt taken? Why doſt thou not die? The Vines will flouriſh never the leſſe for thy abſence; Thou only ſerveſt to conſume the fruits of the Earth.</p>
            <p>She began lately more to reſpect me than ſhe hath been accuſtomed to do, to make a trial (as it is to be preſumed) if I would be ſo very a Fool as to make my ſelf away for her; I knew her Intention, and to prove how great was the affection ſhe did bear unto me, and what ſhe would doe and ſay, if I were out of the world, I did counterfeit my ſelf to be dead.</p>
            <p>In this contrivement a Coſin of mine did much aſſiſt me, at whoſe Houſe I was yeſterday very late in the Evening, who came unto my Wife to acquaint her, that having drank ſomething, He knew not what, that was mingled in a glaſſe with White wine, I did throw my ſelf upon the Bed, where I was drawing to an end. This News did not ſoften her heart at all; She made anſwer, That ſhe had ſo great a deſire to ſleep, that ſhe could not riſe to come unto me without the moſt apparent danger in the world. Finding that, we attended till this Morning to put an end unto our Enterprize; He brought me hither, having one of his Servants to aſſiſt him, and put me upon this Bed, where ever ſince I have lain like a dead Man; and addreſſing himſelf to my Wife, he ſaid unto her, Behold your dead Husband! I am ſorry that you were not preſent when he ſurrendred his Soul to God, you might then have known his laſt Will, and ſeen with what diligence I have aſſiſted him. She made anſwer in groans unto him, O God! Is my good Man dead? I ſhall never find another that will equal him in the goodneſſe of his Diſpoſition; Tell me what he ſaid unto you being near unto his end; Keep not one word from me, it will ſerve for a great conſolation to me. He replyed, You do much deceive your ſelf, it will ſerve unto you for Remorſe of Conſcience all you life, if you have a relenting Soul, and carefull of its own Salvation. My Coſin aſſured me, that you were the Cauſe of his Death, and that he came to my houſe as to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, to protect him from the afflictions which he indured in your Company. Alas! (ſaid ſhe) How unhappy am I? What diſcourteſies have I done him, that he died with ſo much rancor againſt me? He will not then pray to God for me in the other world? Saint <hi>Mary!</hi> Our Neighbors can all witneſſe the good Entertainment that he always hath received from me; It is above a month ago ſince the leaſt noiſe was heard in our houſe. Son of
<hi>David!</hi> I was ſo ready to obey all his Commandments, that but yeſterday I though I ſhould have broke my neck in running down the ſtairs to fetch his Wine for him; Alas poor Man! He never drank ſince in my Company, and never now ſhall drink in it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>My Coſin gave her leave to make an end of her dolefull Complaints, and departed from her, to underſtand whether her griefs were counterfeit or not; He was no ſooner gone, but ſhe ſent for that Woman whom you ſee, who is no better than her ſelf, and for her Adulterer alſo; She ſaid unto them, Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, My Husband is dead, Have not I a good Cauſe to weep? The old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man replyed unto her, Are you a Fool? Do you forget the Wiſhes that ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten you have made? She made anſwer, No my good Friend; But what will the Neighbours ſay, if I ſhall not weep? And ſince it is the Cuſtom to weep, let me alone, I will have tears in abundance, although I have occaſion enough to laugh, I will have Onions always in my Handkerchief, and wipe my eyes with them; Speaking thoſe words, her tears ceaſed, Her eyes have learn'd the trick to make her tears to run, and ceaſe when ſhe pleaſeth. She after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards proceeded in her Diſcourſe, Upon my Faith he hath done well to die, and I wondred what he meant ſo long to deferr it, I therefore reſolved with my <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59287:108"/>ſelf to aſſiſt him in it; for having long ago made ſo many deep proteſtations to me, to diſlodge from this world, I conceived with my ſelf, that if he tarried any longer in it, he muſt needs be damn'd for not keeping his word, if he ſhould have upright Judges: Am I not now a happy Woman? all that is in this Houſe is mine. He hath given me it all, at the Contract of his Marriage. I have now gained by St. <hi>John,</hi> for the evil life which I did lead with him. All the Night long he lay be me as unmovable as a Block. He had one Member of his Body, which long ago, for ought that I do know, was as intirely dead, as if it had been touched with Thunder. Her Companion replyed unto her, Comfort your ſelf then, Behold where your Friend is! who will give you the beſt Content in the world. Hereupon, becauſe all the Curtains about the Bed were drawn, that I could not be diſcovered, I lifted up my head a little, and peeping through a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle place where the Curtains lay open at the foot of the Bed, I beheld this gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, imbracing, and kiſſing my Wife. The pains which I took to raiſe my head, were ſuch, that it gave an unexpected paſſage to a furious wind which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from me, and did much amaze them all. O Lord! (ſaid my Wife) He is not dead, Hark how he farteth? You will be a Fool ſtill (ſaid her Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) Do you think that dead Bodies do not break wind? Why, things that have no life at all do fart. Be you where you will, you ſhall in every place hear ſomething or other that will make ſuch a noiſe, be it never ſo little. As for him, It may be that ſome of his Eones made a crack at the diſ-joynting of them: or rather, it was ſome wind which remained yet in his Body, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not the paſſage open, could not but with violence break forth. Beſides, we ought to believe, that his Body (being heavy as it is) did cauſe the Bed to crack, which is made but of the thinneſt wood. Ah Villain! (ſaid my Wife) It was all his delight to break wind backward when he was alive, and now he doth practiſe it being dead. He had the wind at Command, and high or low, would make it ſo to blow at his pleaſure, that I wonder the State did not ſend for him, to make him their Mariner. He would oftentimes lay wagers to let ſuch a number of Farts at once, which ſhould all come ratling from him like a peal of Ordnance, and in two or three hundred at a clap the would not miſſe you one of his number. It was his ordinary ſport amongſt his Companions, and he did get a great deal of money by it; But (my good Friend) that we may be ſure to be troubled with him no more, It were better for us to bury him too ſoon, then too late; Let us therefore put our hands to the work, and give me a needle and thred.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoke thoſe words, ſhe did draw the Curtain, and as ſhe ſtooped to look upon me, (it being high time for me to act out my part, having known the ſmall Eſteem ſhe had of me) I lifted up my Arm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and applyed my hand faſt unto her cheek, which did put her into an exceſſe of fear. I ſaid unto her, I am not yet dead, you Slut, and (if it ſhall pleaſe God) I one day ſhall lay thee in the Earth; and ſince, without juſt Cauſe, thou ſo maliciouſly doſt deſire that I ſhould depart out of this world, Heaven, the more to enrage and puniſh thee, will permit that I ſhall continue here a long time. Then they all three fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and being unwilling to believe that I was alive, becauſe they deſired I were dead, they did their beſt indeavour to ſhrowd me, and bury me in this Linnen ſheet. I made reſiſtance as long as poſſibly I could, crying out Help, Help, Murder, Murder, and telling them that I was not dead. I do believe they had a deſire to have ſtrangled me, and no doubt they had put it in Execution, if out of your goodneſſe you had not come to my ſuccour, being (as I believe) invited to it by my Cries. Now Sir, I do beſeech you, that you will vouchſafe to aſſiſt me, having underſtood the Juſtice of my Cauſe. Procure that they perſecute me no more, as they did before your Comming, and be pleaſed to be a Protector of the miſerable.</p>
            <p>When he had thus ended his Speech, <hi>Francion,</hi> who underſtood the Juſtice <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59287:109"/>of his cauſe, deſired to make peace amongſt them, and the young Ruffian, and the old woman who accompanied him, departed, fearing they ſhould be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. The woman of the houſe perceiving that the Gentleman deſired to dine there, did goe down into the Kitchin, confuſed, and aſhamed, to make preparations for his Dinner. All that time her Husband was putting on his Cloathes, and kept cloſe to <hi>Francion,</hi> with whom he diſcourſed on diverſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. After dinner, <hi>Francion</hi> cauſed his wife to appear, and ſaid unto them both, that they muſt both of them before him, make a long, and a durable friendſhip. The Husband, who deſired nothing but Love and Honeſty, did eaſily conſent unto it, and the Wife did the ſame, being conſtrayned by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. I will then, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> that <hi>Robin</hi> immediatly doe ſhew me, if he be not ſufficiently valiant of himſelf to give his wife content, without making her to run to the Court for help.</p>
            <p>Fair Ladies, you that without bluſhing cannot endure to hear thoſe things ſpoken of which beſt of all you do love, I know well enough, that if you caſt your eyes on this paſſage, and on many other places of this Book, you will preſently lay it by, and peradventure will hate me, or at leaſt will ſo diſſemble to doe, to ſhew your ſelves chaſt and retired; Nevertheleſſe I love the truth ſo much, that for all the coyneſſe of your humour, I will conceal nothing, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of that, which doth profit more by being divulged, than by having it buried in ſilence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robin,</hi> after ſome unwillingneſſe, did accord to the deſire of <hi>Francion,</hi> being very glad to have the eyes of ſo great a perſonage to be the unreproachable Witneſſes of the proofs of his valour, but his Wife ſeemed to be much aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and affirmed, that ſhe had rather die than endure that ſuch a thing ſhould be ſeen before the eyes of the world. And why ſo, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> Doe not all men know that which you two doe being both together? Doe you deſire to conceal it? To what purpoſe will that ſerve you? When I have ſeen you to have done it, were I the greateſt babler in the world, all that I could ſay would be but that I have ſeen you to have done it. And what news would that be? I may ſay as much now, for it is but the Truth. Moreover, doe you think I am not as able to judge of this buſineſſe as well as the Chirurgians? and that I cannot make as true a judgement as they, whereby you ſhall not be troubled to run to the Spiritual Court, where it will coſt you as much mony as atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance? For all theſe reaſons, the Hoſteſſe remained in her firſt obſtinate Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and <hi>Francion</hi> purſuing his intentions, told her, that if ſhe would not doe it, he would command all his ſervants, to hold her by her Arms, until <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi> had accompliſhed his Deſire; And without any more adoe he took her himſelf, and threw her on the Bed, and commanded
<hi>Robin</hi> to begin what he had to doe; who, after that the Cavallier had commanded his ſervants to depart, and ſtayed alone himſelf in the Chamber, did ſhew himſelf ready to obey him. But it is ſaid, that whenever his Servants were gone, <hi>Francion</hi> cauſed him to wave the incounter, for he would firſt ſee if he were well provided with all things that were neceſſary for him. Moreover, the Detractors doe affirm, that he made them afterwards to begin the fight again, and did furniſh them with new precepts of Love; you may believe which you pleaſe. It may ſuffice to underſtand, that he judged they had no cauſe to be diſcontented at one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without making any mention unto you, either of erection or intromiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ejaculation, which are words that relliſh more of the Court of the Church, than of the Court at the <hi>Louvre.</hi> The Hoſteſſe had a Siſter to marry, and ſome there were that did goe ſinging up and down the village, That ſhe muſt take a Husband upon proof, becauſe that her Siſter was deceived. But no great heed ought to be taken to that ſlander.</p>
            <p>Behold this is all that we have to ſpeak like a Libertine in this Book; Are you aſhamed to look upon it Gentlemen and Ladies who are the Readers? <pb n="24" facs="tcp:59287:109"/>The ſtories which are here to be read, are not ſo guilty that they were made on purpoſe to prompt you unto Vice; Our deſign is, to make you expreſſely to hate it, by ſetting before your eyes the bad ſucceſſe of enormous enterpriſes. Whatſoever it be, it may eaſily be diſcerned that it was not made for the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of religious Votareſſes, but to inſtruct thoſe how to live that are in the world, where every day they are inforced to underſtand many other things of this Nature; for what offences be there that are not dayly brought to the knowledge of the Courts of Juſtice, and how can it be remedied, but that they will adminiſter a Subject of diſcourſe in all Companies?</p>
            <p>But if my excuſes are of no validity, and you can find nothing in this Book to pleaſe you, Readers, whoſoever you are, doe not read it the ſecond time, I did not make it for yours, but for my own particular pleaſure. Doe not buy it, if you have no mind to it, there is no man will inforce you to it. But if you have it, and that altogether it doth diſpleaſe you, caſt it into the fire, and if there be but one part only which is diſagreeable to you, either tear it, or blot it out, and make your profit of the reſt. But if ſome words only be againſt your heart, I give you the fair liberty to inſert others which you ſhall better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove. I believe there are very few Authors who will ſay as much, and leſſe that will grant it, but they are all too ſtubborn, and doe tye themſelves to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent vanities; For my part, I will take my own Swing, and delight my ſelf, without reflecting on any other. Do you afterwards, if you can, follow my Counſels, and allow of my intentions. But let us now purſue our more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Francion</hi> had made his Hoſt and his Hoſteſſe perfect friends, he came down, being followed by them to have the reckoning paid, which was no ſooner caſt up, but it was immediatly diſcharged. Moreover he gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them three Piſtols of gold, to invite them to remember him when he was gone, and in the remembrance of him to appeaſe all their old differences, and he promiſed them that he would give them a greater Donation, if he were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed that they continued in the obligation of their love; But if he heard to the contrary, he threatned rigorouſly to puniſh their new diſſentions. It is ſaid, that his Remonſtrances were of great efficacy, and that ever ſince they lived in peace, and have had Children.</p>
            <p>A certain man who came to dine at the Tavern, obſerving the bounty and great gifts of <hi>Francion,</hi> did bear a great reſpect unto him, and ſeeing him to take horſe, did take horſe alſo, and underſtanding that he travelled the ſame way, he did deſire to accompany him. The firſt diſcourſe with him, was, the praiſing of his Liberality, from which he fell to the diſpraiſe of Avarice, of which he told him he could furniſh him with a moſt remarkable example, of a Gentleman who lived in a Village, where the next night they were to lodge, He is the moſt wretched man, ſaid he, that the Earth did ever bear; his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants are moſt unhappy to have ſuch a Landlord, he doth exact upon them in a thouſand ways. The laſt year he made them believe, that he had a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to goe to the war for the ſervice of the King, and that his poor Tenants muſt be at the charge to give him two light Horſes, nevertheleſſe he did not goe at all, but only made a journey to the Court, where he ſtayed about a moneth.</p>
            <p>He ſent afterwards to them a company of the Gen-darmes, which belonged to one of his friends, to ſatisfie his malicious Avarice, who had plundered them to ſome purpoſe, but that reflecting on his own profit, he thought it was more diſcretion for him to pillage them himſelf, and he was ſorry that by his dayly extorſion, he had made them ſo poor, that they could contibute no more unto him. You will hardly believe how he hath cauſed them to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, both in their bodies and their purſes, when they have gathered up but ſome ſmall ſticks which they have found about his woods. When he hireth d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y-labourers,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59287:110"/>he at his pleaſure putteth back the clock, and makes them to work two hours longer than they are accuſtomed to labour in other places. He kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth all his Servants in the moſt penurious way that poſſibly can be imagined; When he putteth Peaſe, or Lentils into the Pot to be boyled, he doth count them one by one, and hath learned Geometry, on purpoſe that his Compaſſe may ſerve him to meaſure the bread, to know how much they have eaten. Never any man could make his boaſt that he hath Feaſted with him. When his friends (if he hath any) doe come in, and enter at the fore-door of his houſe to ſee him, he, for fear to entertain them, doth go out at the Back-door, and takes his walk in unfrequented places, where it is impoſſible to find him. In his houſe there is no difference at all in their Diet; and for his Grooms he taketh none but thoſe who are of a melancholick, or a Flegmatick complexion, becauſe that thoſe who are of a cholerick humor are commonly too great Eaters. One time he entertained a Cook, but he ſoon afterwards deſired leave to be gone, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to him, That if he ſtayed any longer in his houſe, he ſhould forget his Trade.</p>
            <p>This Covetous wretch, obſerving his Children to grow up, did one day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of it, contrary to all other men, who are very glad to ſee their Children to increaſe in years, hoping thereby to receive a ſudden and abſolute content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by ſeeing them either well married, or to be indued with ſome eminent quality or ſignal virtue, for their advancement. His reaſon was, That for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he never makes himſelf ready, but on Sundays only, and on Holydays, when he goes to ſhew himſelf in his Pariſh Church; and he then he puts on a Linſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woolſy frock upon his Cloaths when ever he comes home, and he will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to ſtir from his feat on that day, ſo great a fear he hath to indamage his apparel by wearing. It is reported, that the beſt habiliments he hath, are thoſe of his great Grandfathers, by which he is ſomtimes pleaſed to be known, and which moſt carefully he preſerveth; intending to bequeath and intayl them with his Benediction to his Poſterity. On working-dayes he is covered alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with raggs.</p>
            <p>As I remember (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) you called this perſon, Gentleman; Do you believe, in good earneſt, that he deſerves that title, living a life ſo fordid? One of the moſt principal Ornaments of Nobility, is Liberality.</p>
            <p>Sir (ſaid he who did accompany him) I muſt acknowledge that I have failed in calling him Gentleman, although he hath many Lordſhips; for by deſcent he is no Gentleman at all: His Father was one of the greateſt Uſurers in <hi>France,</hi> and made it all his buſineſſe to give pernicious advice to others, to heap up mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and to ſow diſſention. Nevertheleſſe his Son, and his Daughter, who are one of them at the Age of Twenty, and the other of Eighteen, do nothing partake at all of the humors of his race; They are both of them indued with generaous Souls, It is pity that they have a Father who will do nothing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance them. His Daughter is very beautifull, and wants for no attractions to procure her Sweet-hearts; but what is ſhe the better for it? A man can never find the opportunity to court her, ſhe is always at her Mothers elbow; a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as miſerable as her Husband, who will not permit her to go into any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, for fear it will coſt him too much to put her into good habiliments, Nay, which is more, Signior
<hi>Buiſſon,</hi> who is her Father, is ſo fearfull to disburſe his money, that he will not hear of any Husband for her. His Son is at this preſent a Priſoner, partly by his own will, and partly by force; for he deſireth not to be ſeen abroad, and accompany other Gentlemen of his rank, having neither apparel to grace, nor train to attend, or ſilver to aſſiſt him, either at play or at revellings. Not long ſince he was even with his Father, who being faln ſick, and not able to travel to the City to pay a round ſum of Silver which he owed to a Merchant, he was conſtrained, to his great grief, to commit the <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59287:110"/>charge thereof unto his Son; for he was ſo miſerable, that he would hardly truſt himſelf with his own Goods. His Son being tempted with that profitable metal, which he ſeldom carried about him, did determine to keep it for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; And inſtead of carrying it where he was commanded, he did bury it in the middle of a Field, and having ſold his Horſe and Cloak, he returned in a moſt melancholly diſguiſe unto his Father, and acquainted him, That he had been aſſaulted by Thieves, who had diſmounted him, and not only deprived him of his Horſe, but had taken from him by force his Money, and his Cloak. You may imagin in what a paſſion old <hi>Buiſſon</hi> was, he knew not on whom to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his Revenge; at the laſt he imputed all the fault unto his Son, he call'd him Knave, and did beat him ſoundly, becauſe he made no more haſt out of doors, and did not keep the ordinary High-way, where he might poſſibly have found one honeſt Traveller or other, who would have relieved him. He gave a charge to the Provoſt of the Marſhalſeys to make enquiry after the perſons who did ſteal the money. One of the Officers knowing the colour of the hair, and the height of the Horſe, was ſo diligent, that at laſt he found him in an adjacent Village, as with a halter he was led forth from the Stable unto water. On his Return, he did go to the dwelling-houſe to which the Stable did belong, and demanded of the Maſter, Who it was that ſold that Horſe unto him? He made anſwer, he was a young Man, but his Name and Quality he could not tell; but if it were his chance to ſee him, he ſhould know him again very well. By ill fortune, young
<hi>Buiſſon</hi> at that time paſſed by, and the Maſter of the Houſe ſaid immediatly to the Officer, Look, yonder he is without all doubt, lay hands on him. The Officer replyed, Take heed you deceive not your ſelf; for he who goes there, is the Son of that Man who hath loſt the Horſe. The other replyed, It is moſt aſſuredly the ſame young Man who ſold the Horſe to me. The Officer being contented with this aſſurance, returned to the old Signior, who confronted his Son with it: his Son was immediately convinced, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the fury of his Father, did ſecretly depart out of the Caſtle, belike, to find out his buried money, by the help of which he hath conveyed himſelf away ſo far, that he hath never ſince been ſeen. At the laſt he will be inforced to come back again, although it be for nothing elſe but to claim his ſhare in the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; knowing that the loſſe of this money will be the only way to break his Fathers heart. That which cometh by the Muſick of the Cornet, returneth back at the Sound of the Trumpet. Goods ill got, will infallibly be one day ill expended: When the young Man hath them once in his poſſeſſion, we need not ask what Riot he will make.</p>
            <p>By this may be underſtood, what pleaſure men take to cramm their Purſes with Crowns, which they ſhall be then inforced to leave, when they think leaſt of it. For my ſelf, I know not which of them to blame moſt, either the Father, or the Son: Both of them have failed in their duty, but I cannot deny but that all the world may ſee, that the fault firſt of all did proceed from the Father, who by his miſerableneſſe hath, in a manner, provoked his Son to take that from him by force, which he would not give him of good will. Without doubt God is pleaſed that the Son, who proceeded from his own bowels, ſhould be his ſcourge, to puniſh him for his avarice. That may well be (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) and I believe that Heaven hath ſent me alſo upon earth to puniſh the ſame ſin: I proteſt unto you, I will not ſpare him at all, or my Spirit ſhall be barren in Invention. Tell me only, If you have any Intereſt in him? Yes Sir, replyed the other; for I live in a Farm which is but a League from his Caſtle, and have learned all his Genealogy and manner of life of a certain Boy who ſerved him, who comes oftentimes to my houſe. Give me then an Account of it (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) without omitting any thing; whereupon he who did accompany him, did declare whatſoever he had heard of him; I will meaſure him then (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) by the length of his own Ell, That will do it. Is he not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely <pb n="27" facs="tcp:59287:111"/>ambitious, to fill up the number of all his other Vices? Is he not eaſie to be perſwaded, that he is one of the moſt noble, and moſt apparent of all that Province? You hit the nail on the head, replyed the other; If you had eaten a whole buſhel of Salt with him, you could not have known him better. It is the height and force of all his deſire to be eſteemed a Gentleman, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes he hath baſtinadoed ſome, who have ſaid he was no Gentleman, and that he ought to come behind them. So, ſo, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> I will goe to him howſoever, I will make him as noble as my ſelf, whether he will, or not, for I know that otherwiſe at the beginning he will not approve of that which I ſhall perform, to arrive to my intent.</p>
            <p>As they were in this diſcourſe, they approached unto a little Wood, near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which they heard a noiſe, as if ſome men were offering violence to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Our Adventurer who would know all things, and puniſh all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits which he ſaw committed, did put ſpurs to his horſe, being followed by his people, he perceived four ſturdy fellows holding a young Gentleman by his Collar, having firſt diſmounted him. Although he made his approaches near unto them, yet they would not abandon him, and becauſe the young Gentleman would not goe with them, as they would have him, they dragged him along with all their force. You Villains, what will you doe to that gallant young man, ſaid <hi>Francion?</hi> One of them made anſwer, It doth not belong to you at all, let it ſuffice you to underſtand that our proceedings are approved by Juſtice; Juſtice, ſaid
<hi>Francion,</hi> What vertuous Lady is that whom you call Juſtice, who cauſeth honeſt men to be ſo rudely intreated? Let the Gentleman go, or I profeſſe unto you you ſhall dearly repent it. Sir, ſaid another of them, you will give us leave to execute our charge, we are the Kings Officers, we are carrying this Man to priſon for his debts. And is it only for that? ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> I ſwear unto you, he ſhall not goe. Having ſpoke thoſe words, he drew his Sword, and all thoſe who were with him did the like, and did charge upon the Serjeants with ſo much reſolution, that they inforced them to ſhew their heels to their Enemies. The Neighbour of old
<hi>Buiſſon</hi> approaching, ſaid unto <hi>Francion,</hi> Sir, This Gentleman whom you have reſcued, is young <hi>Buiſſon.</hi> In a good hour, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> I am glad at my heart that I have thus met with him. On that the young Gentleman did approach unto him, to thank him, with ſuch words as expreſſed the generoſity of his Spirit, which invited
<hi>Franci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to uſe him with all humanity of reſpect. He then demanded of him, if it were for debt that they would have carried him to priſor? <hi>Buiſſon</hi> made anſwer, yes, and that his Father allowing him no means, he was inforced to borrow ſome moneys of the Uſurer, who, having need of it, did thus rudely purſue him to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render it. In this entertainment of diſcourſe they arrived at the Town where they intended to ſup and lodge that night. There were two men drinking in the Inn as they entred into the Court, one of them had a Noſe as red as a Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who eſpying young <hi>Buiſſon,</hi> made a ſign to his Comrade; After that they did both fall to their cups harder than before, having ſome ſlices of a Gammon of Bacon brought unto them, the more to excite their thirſt. Here (ſaid one of them) holding the glaſſe in his hand, Keeper of the Jayl of my Stomach, Make ready the Writ for this valiant Champion whom I am going to put into the hole. See yet, ſaid he, another glaſſe of wine, which hath choſen to take its lodging in the ward of my Belly, and ſpeaking thoſe words he drank it off. Companion (replyed the other) having firſt drank a glaſſe of wine, I give you the aſſignation, before the throne of the Deity of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> to inform me for what cauſe you doe not drink in time and place? I will not make appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſaid the other, and if you ſhall levy upon the default, whereby I ſhall be conſtrained to pay the expence, and be condemned afterwards for contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, I will appeal from you, as from an incompetent Iudge, and demand to be brought before my Iudge natural, and domiciliar, as in an Action purely <pb n="28" facs="tcp:59287:111"/>perſonal. It is no matter for the apparence, ſaid the firſt, I will have a Deed ſigned and delivered by the Drawer within, by which it ſhall be certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that I have drunk more than thou haſt. See here a Pint pot, ſaid the other, which ſeems to me not to be compared to this which is the Original, and hath the mark of the City on it, It is a great deal too little, and the Wine is not good, I will obtain therefore Letters Patents ſealed with the great Seal to relieve my ſelf, becauſe I have conſented to give ſix Souſes for that which is worth but four. But to the purpoſe my Camerade, Thou eateſt up all the bread which I doe cut. I will form a Complaint for this abuſe, and cauſe thee to appeal in a Caſe of Seiſin, and Treſpaſſe.</p>
            <p>They had much other diſcourſe to this purpoſe, which
<hi>Francion</hi> underſtood, and did ſwear he did conceive them to be Serjeants, not only by reaſon of their Countenance, but by the terms of practice which at every word incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruoſly enough proceeded from them, and moreover he ſuſpected, that they were in the number of thoſe who would have dragged <hi>Du Buiſſon</hi> unto priſon. To prove if it were true, he left him aloue in the next room, and did goe out of the gate himſelf with all his train, pretending that he had a great deſire to ſee ſome of the ſingularities in the City. Immediatly the Serjeants, who had all this while a deſign to carry <hi>Buiſſon</hi> to priſon, did goe to look him out, and having ſhewed him their Authority, they did begin to exerciſe their office: but <hi>Francion</hi> and his people immediatly returning, did hinder them from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding any further; and having ſhut the gate of the Inn upon them, he told them that they were at his mercy, and that were it not for him they had both been killed.</p>
            <p>Theſe poor Gigots of Iuſtice cryed for mercy to
<hi>Francion,</hi> and <hi>Buiſſon,</hi> and aſſured them that they would not have undertaken it, but that they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to it. You are a couple of Fools, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> who doe not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand your own Trade, I will teach it you. Will any Serjeant that hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion with him uſe ſuch words of Art as you have done before the friends of him whom you deſire to arreſt? Doe you not conſider that it is more than ſufficient to diſcover who you are? It was for this reaſon only that you failed in your enterpriſe on this gallant Gentleman, for which I am very glad; But go too, tell me at my requeſt, whoſe Priſoner ſhould he be? Sir, ſaid one of them, he ſhould be priſoner to ſuch a Merchant of this City. I know him very well, ſaid <hi>Buiſſon,</hi> he is one of the moſt deceitfull dealers that is in it. He ſold unto me bad ſtuffs at a very high price, and helped me himſelf to find out a Man who would buy them of me at a low rate with his own money, ſo that his ware returned again to his own ſhop. For my ſelf I did not care, becauſe I had got ſome ſilver, of which I was in need, and never minded the danger to come. He was always importunate with me to come unto his ſhop, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me I ſhould have what ſtuffs I would, truſting to the great riches of my Father.
<hi>Francion</hi> having whiſpered <hi>Buiſſon</hi> in the ear, commanded one of the Drawers to goe to the Merchants houſe, and acquaint him on the behalf of the Serjeants, that the young Gentleman who was indebted to him was there ready to pay him, and that he ſhould come with all the ſpeed he could. The Merchant being come, Supper was ſerved in, and the payment being deferred till after Supper, the Merchant was placed amongſt the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants to eat with them. He and his Camerades did drink ſo deeply, that the fumes did begin to aſcend into their brains. <hi>Francion</hi> did give unto one of his Lackeys a certain powder that he had taken with him amongſt his other curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, which being mingled in the wine they drank of, did render them ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, that they ſeemed to have rather the Souls of brute beaſts than of men. There was no longer any reaſon in their words, and one might doe with them what he pleaſed; for they were as inſenſible Creatures.
<hi>Francion</hi> ſeeing them in that condition, did examine their pockets, and took from them the Bills <pb n="29" facs="tcp:59287:112"/>and Bonds which the Merchant had brought, and the Writs and Capiaſſes of the Serjeants, and burn'd them all before <hi>Buiſſon,</hi> who gave him a thouſand thanks for the favours he received.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion</hi> afterwards called for the Vintner, and complained to him that he had ſent up Wine ſo heavily daſhed, that thoſe poor men of the City who were not ſo much accuſtomed to drink as thoſe of his Retinue, were extremely intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, although they had not drunk ſo much as his Servants had done. The Vintner replyed, Theſe gallants, Sir, at leaſt the two Serjeants whom there you ſee, were more than half drunk before they came to Supper to your Table. Did you not ſee them carouſing together as you came into the Inne? I will ſend unto their Wives to fetch them home. For this Man (pointing to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant) I will take the pains, ſaid he, to lead him home my ſelf.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoke thoſe words, he commanded one of his Servants to look out the Serjeants wives, who gave them a thouſand evil words, as they did lead them home, and that which did incenſe them, was, that they could not get one word of ſenſe from them. When the Merchant was come to his own houſe, his Wife demanding of him if he had received the money which was due unto him? He being not ſo ſtupified as the other, had the underſtanding to make anſwer to her, That ſhe had a great deſire to be brave; and taking a good Cudgel, he did fall upon her, as if the Devil had been in him; Nevertheleſſe he had not the leaſt conſideration, whether he had received the money or not, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the ſtealing away of his Papers.</p>
            <p>The next Morning, underſtanding the loſſe of them, he did run in a great rage unto the Tavern; but the gueſts were gone very early in the Morning, wiſely foreſeeing what was like to enſue: ſo that the Merchant learned to his own Coſt, not to cozen young Gentlemen any more, nor truſt them with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to be exchanged into ready mony, and imployed in unprofitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences. <hi>Francion</hi> nevertheleſſe adviſed the young Man to give him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing when he was able to ſpare it, accordingly as his Conſcience ſhould direct him.</p>
            <p>When he was on the way, he asked him to what place he had a deſire to go. Not that way as you ſteer your courſe, replyed the young Man; becauſe that you are travelling towards my Fathers Caſtle, before whom I dare not preſent my ſelf. I have taken ſome money from him, which I will imploy to the beſt advantage I can, and I am now going to find out a Lord in this Country, who being my near Kinſman, will freely entertain me in his Houſe. Well, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> becauſe you are diſpoſed to ramble, find out the means to come to <hi>Rome,</hi> where ſome moneths hence undoubtedly you will find me, and you may there paſſe away your time better, than in any other place of the world; Your humor pleaſeth me ſo much, that I deſire to enjoy your Company longer. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpoke thoſe words, he friendly imbraced him, and left him to his own liberty to take which way he pleaſed.</p>
            <p>He who did ſpeak unto him of old <hi>Buiſſon,</hi> was yet in his Company, and did not forſake him, till he had brought him within ſight of the Caſtle: <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> taking his leave of him, aſſured him that within few days he ſhould receive the News of what he had done, and ſo he departed; putting the beſt face he could on his well-grounded Reſolution, and commanded the Groom of his Chamber to take out of his Sumpter the richeſt Cloak he had, becauſe he had a deſire to paſſe for ſome great Signior.</p>
            <p>We ſhall in the next Book ſee what War he doth make with Avarice, which is one of the moſt enormous Vices in the world; and in that we may underſtand that this Comical Hiſtory containeth in it many things Satyrical, to render it the more profitable; for it is not ſufficient to lay forth Vices in all their colours to the eye, unleſſe we ſhall undertake alſo effectually to reprove them.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His brave Cavallier whoſe Adventures we have traced, did at laſt arrive at the gates of the Caſtle of the Covetous Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior; he would have ſent in one of his Servants before hand as a Harbinger, to advertiſe him of his Comming, were it not for fear that he would have ſtollen away, that he might he not ſee him. He came into the Hall, where he found the venerable perſonage ſitting, and reading in a Book of Husbandry, to diſcover that which he might yet put in practiſe to increaſe the profit of his Lands; Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur, ſaid <hi>Francion</hi> to him, the extreme deſire I have to ſee you, and to witneſs unto you how affectionate I am to do you Service, hath conſtrained me to leave the way which my affairs obliged me to keep, boldly to make my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to your Caſtle. Signior
<hi>Buiſſon</hi> replyed, I beſeech you, Sir, to tell me who you are, for I know you not? I know you as well as my ſelf, ſaid <hi>Franci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> your Renown is ſpread in all places; For my ſelf, I am called
<hi>Francion,</hi> Marquis <hi>de la Parte;</hi> I am nearly allied to you, I will tell you by what extraction; thereupon he ravell'd out the whole Genealogy, following that which was deſcribed to him: and although another might obſerve the falſities therein, the old Signior did perſwade himſelf it was true, ſo over-joyd he was, that a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis who had ſo honourable a train, did call him Coſin of his own motion, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it would be ſufficient to prove his Nobility againſt all contradiction. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by his language teſtified unto <hi>Francion,</hi> what honour and contentment this acknowledgement did bring unto him, the firſt Courteſy which he uſed, was to ſay unto him, I believe you were never in this Country before, nor any of your Secvants, and therefore they cannot tell where good Lodgings may be had for them, and Stables for your Horſes, I will direct them to a good Tavern, to which they and their Horſes may retire themſelves; my Man ſhall go along with them to conduct them. <hi>Francion</hi> obſerving that <hi>Du Buiſſon</hi> had a deſire to ſhow him a proof of his ordinary miſerableneſſe, reſolved not to give way unto it, and ſaid unto him, Coſin, I have always occaſion for my Servants, and deſire that they may not be removed from me; And as for my horſes, I am loath they ſhould be left in an Inne, where none of my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are preſent to have a Care of them; Beſides, I dare aſſure you they are ſo weary, that they are hardly able to go ſo farr.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Francion</hi> did defend himſelf at the firſt Incounter. <hi>Buiſſon</hi> perceiving that he could not deny him, did immediatly command that Supper ſhould be <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59287:113"/>ſerved in, which was only a Shoulder of Mutton, with ſome Sallets, and ſaid unto
<hi>Francion,</hi> Sir, You muſt be contented with a very poor Supper, It is no more than what I have ordinarily for my ſelf; I had no knowledge of your Comming (as I ought to have) to provide your better chear, and which is worſe, my Wife is ſick in Bed, and there is not any one within to attend the Kitchin, and to put their helping hand to the Work. Make not ſo much haſt (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) we will loſe nothing for want of attendance, I will give you all the leiſure that can be deſired to make ready what you pleaſe, and if you have any Viands that are more delicate than other, I pray ſerve them in, for on ſuch only I am accuſtomed to feed. I obſerved your ſtore of Fowl as I paſſed by them, I have not ſeen any place in <hi>France</hi> that is better provided; if I did not know that you were extraordinarily furniſhed with all things, I would not be ſo importunate with you to content my appetite: And now I do better remember it, A man of this Country whom I met with in the way, told me, that there is one in this Town who goes every day a hunting, and ſells what he takes to thoſe who will buy it: You may do well, Coſin, to ſend unto him for ſome Veniſon and Partridges. The Covetous old Man was conſtrained to do thoſe things to which <hi>Francion</hi> did invite him, promiſing to himſelf, that he ſhould be only for that evening at that exceſſive charge, and that his Gueſt on the next Morning would purſue his intended Journy. But he was amazed to ſee himſelf ſo over-run beyond his account;
<hi>Francion</hi> obſerving it, ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, My dear Coſin, Do not ſo much torment your Spirit, as it appears to me you do; It may be that I cannot this Night be entertained according to your deſire; All the dayes that I ſtay with you, we will make every day bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter chear than other. You ſhall have more opportunity to provide your ſelf with all the delicates that can be had. I love your converſation ſo well, that it will be a great grief unto me to depart from your houſe. How! (ſaid <hi>Buiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> to himſelf) Muſt I be ſo long enforced to keep this Man here, with all his train? Ah, Here is Thrift and Providence indeed! Doth he hope that I ſhall yet make him better chear? How is it poſſible? Hath he a deſire to undo me? One of his Servants who hath imployed himſelf in my Kitchin, hath demanded ſo much Spice, and Butter, and other Ingredients to ſeaſon the Viands, that in one Supper all my proviſions are made uſe of.</p>
            <p>In this apprehenſion he ſpake unto <hi>Francion,</hi> and adviſed him, that on the next Morning as ſoon as poſſibly he could he would proceed in his Journy; beca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe the Time was not to be he loſt, ſince the weather was fair, and well-diſpoſed; and if he ſhould ſtay another week, there would fall out many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, by reaſon of the great rains to come, for, he ſaid, he followed the Predictions in the Almanack of the Curate of
<hi>Milmonts,</hi> who lyed not. My dear Coſin, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> If the next week there be ſuch bad weather, I will not depart, but will ſtay till the next week following. But Coſin, replyed <hi>Buiſſon,</hi> There will be alſo after that week fifteen days of moſt tempeſtuous weather. Well then, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> I muſt have patience till the whole month be over; But one word more, dear Coſin, When I go away you muſt lend me four Horſes, as well to draw a little Waggon, which to morrow I will cauſe to be made here, to put my Carriages in it, which is too heavy for my Sumpter-horſe, as alſo to eaſe my Lackeys, who are already almoſt weary with travelling on foot. You ſhall alſo do me the favour to lend me three or four hundred Liuvres, of which I have great need; for when I ſet forth from my own Houſe, I did not think to have travelled ſo far, and therefore took not ſo much money with me as was convenient.</p>
            <p>Theſe words did ſo prick the heart of <hi>Buiſſon,</hi> as if they had been the points of ſo many Swords. As often as <hi>Francion</hi> did propound any thing unto him, he would turn himſelf towards one of the moſt faithfull of all his Grooms, and would ſay unto him, <hi>Guerin, Guerin,</hi> Surely this Man is a Familiar. Supper <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59287:113"/>being ended, he conducted <hi>Francion</hi> to his Chamber, and provided good Beds for all his Servants; afterwards he did go to viſit his Wife, whom he would not let <hi>Francion</hi> ſee, becauſe he pretended ſhe had been a long time aſleep. Finding her awake, he declared to her the new Kinted he had found, and how dear it had coſt him. Ah! (my Love) ſaid he, purſuing his Diſcourſe, I know not what a Devil this Marqueſs is; but if he be a man, he is the boldeſt that ever I ſaw; Why he is more familiar with me, than if he were my own Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and through all his life had made it all his buſineſſe to frequent my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. He tells me of his appetites, and commands they ſhould be ſatisfied. He reformeth all within my houſe that is not pleaſing to him. He conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth me to make ſuperfluous expences, and domineers over all my Servants, as if I had given him Authority ſo to doe. If he ſtays here any long time, I am afraid that he will become Maſter of all, and at the laſt will drive us out of doors. What profit (replyed his Wife) will ſuch acquaintance bring you? Wherefore did you ſuffer him to come into your houſe? I do believe that he is ſome notorious High-way-man; without all doubt he is come to rob us. If you ſaw but his Countenance and his Carriage, ſaid the Covetous Man, you would not be of this opinion; he hath Gentlemen following him, and Lackey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> apparelled after the faſhion of the Court. His Retinue is not made up in haſt, as are the train of thoſe Perſonages who all on the ſudden would be taken for Lords, to put ſome bad enterpriſe in execution. Howſoever, I am reſolved to lodge him no longer than this night, were he more near unto me than my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin German. I ſhall not be much the better, though all the World ſhould know that he hath lodged here a long time, and that he is, indeed, my kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; but on the concrary, the greateſt part of my proviſion would be ſpent, and my Goods diſperſed: <hi>More of Profit, and leſſe of Honour,</hi> was the Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to of my Father. To be of the bloud of a Marqueſſe is not at his diſcretion; although I ſhould make him never ſo good chear, I ſhall be no more his Coſin than I am now, and I ſhall be as much, if I uſe him never ſo coarſely. To ſpeak the truth, I dare not thruſt him out of doors by the head and ſhoulders, but I will uſe ſome gentle means or other to cauſe him to depart, without giving him any open diſcontent. I will pretend to morrow that I have a great proceſſe, which I muſt go to the City to ſollicit; you ſhall make your ſelf to be more ſick than you are, and when they ſhall demand of you for that which ſhall be neceſſary to entertain him, you ſhall counterfe it your ſelf to be in ſome ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fit, and without Senſe; ſo that when he finds me gone for many days, and my return to be very uncertain, and that he can enjoy neither yours, nor my Company, he will undoubtedly be inforced to depart; But I will forbid my People to permit him to take my Horſes along with him, as he ſaith he hath a deſire to do. Madamoiſelle <hi>Buiſſon</hi> did approve the reaſons, and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her Husband, who leaving her in her Chamber, did retire himſelf to lie in another.</p>
            <p>In the mean time her Daughter, who a long time had been courted by a handſom young Gentleman, did advertiſe him by a Letter, that a fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> that a great Lord lodged there that Night, who had put all things in diſorder. The Lover was already come, and ſo favourably, that a Servant belonging to the Caſtle meeting him, took him to be one of the followers of <hi>Francion,</hi> becauſe he was ſo faſhionable. His fair Sweet-heart was with him in a Chamber, between that of the pretended Marquiſſes, and the Chamber of her Father. The amorous Warr was ſo pleaſing to them, that they began it as ſoon as poſſibly they could; They made the Bed to ſhake in ſuch a manner, that her Father in the next room did eaſily perceive it, and all the Night af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he did not put his eye lids together, ſo much of unquietneſſe did
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59287:114"/>perplex his Spirit. He could not but think of that which his Wife had ſaid unto him, and ſometimes he ſo ſuffered himſelf to be carried away by diſtruſt, that he took <hi>Francion</hi> to be ſome grand pillager, who had enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to rob him of whatſoever he had in his houſe; in this violence of ſuſpition he ſaid unto himſelf, As ſoon as day appears, I will not fail to ſend to the Provoſt Marſhal, and all the Marſhals men, to apprehend this Companion. He ſhall be taken in a ſnare. But, good God, doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> think to be more cunning than himſelf, who is the Maſter of all inventions? He peradventure hath done his work already, and is fled away; Ah miſerable man that I am, to be ſo deſperatly ruined, that I know not which way in the world to redreſſe my ſelf. As he was in theſe perplexities, his Daughter and her Sweet-heart coming to re-imbrace each other, did ſhake the bed again with ſo much violence, that he heard it plainly. He knew not that it was his own Daughter who lay there, for he gave expreſſe Order that the Groom of <hi>Francions</hi> Chamber who ſerved him as a Gentleman, ſhould be lodged in it; And becauſe there was a Coffer in that room in which were his richeſt habiliments, he conceived that the noiſe which he heard did proceed from his gueſts, who were breaking open the Coffer to empty it. He liſtned again attentively, and hearing no noiſe at all, I know not what new revolution of thoughts did ſurpriſe his Fancy, and he began to accuſe himſelf of too much ſuſpition, and to believe that he had heard nothing at all, but in imagination only, and ſaid within himſelf, that he was a vain man to take a perſon ſo qualified for a thief; Nevertheleſſe he could not take the leaſt reſt, and going ſoftly out of his chamber, he did ſee if all his Gates were faſt locked, and if every one were aſleep in their lodgings. Being come down into the Court, he was invaded by a thouſand fears; It ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to him, that he ſaw men coming down the window on a Ladder, and ever and anon he would look behind him, to ſee if any one was there ready with a prepared knife to cut his throat. Perceiving at the laſt the error of his judgement, and that it was overcome by vain Illuſions, he returned to his Chamber, where he was no ſooner entred, but he heard the ſame noiſe as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. He knew then that he was not deceived, but did draw more near unto the wall, and moſt attentively liſtned to that which they were doing in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chamber. The young Lover who was not able to conceal his own joys, did ſay at that inſtant unto his Sweet-heart, I ſee now that there is not any thing which <hi>per ſeverance</hi> is not able to bring to effect. I have found the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to open that which was moſt cloſe locked, all muſt give way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
            <p>Now, as Men filled with preſumption, when they hear any doubtfull words reported, they turn them all unto their own glory; and as thoſe who believe they are hated by every one, do turn all to their own prejudice: ſo the fancier of all men doe accommodate themſelves to their own paſſions, and ordinarily doe cauſe thoſe things to appear unto them, which they doe either fear, or hope. This moſt particularly doth appear by covetous perſons, who never ſee two men ſpeaking together, but they believe they diſcourſe of the means how to pillage them of their goods. This old <hi>Buiſſon,</hi> the grand Horeſleech of the world, was of the ſame humour, and hearing theſe words from the Lover of his Daughter, he did give an interpretation to them according to his own ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; He immediatly believed that ſome one endeavoured to open his cheſts, and the ſtrong ſuggeſtion did grow upon his Soul, when the young Gentleman did thus purſue his diſcourſe, I hereafter ſhall have no more cauſe to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

I know not, but I will make a tryal what I can do. Upon my credit thou ſpeakeſt the truth, ſaid old
<hi>Buiſſon,</hi> Thou art poſſeſſor <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59287:114"/>indeed of the choiceſt treaſure in my houſe, ſince thou haſt taken that which I had locked up in my Coffer, but thou ſhalt not carry it away as thou thinkeſt, I ſhall obſtruct the paſſage.</p>
            <p>Aſſuming then unto himſelf a generous reſolution, he took his Sword, and came to the door of the Chamber which he thought to have broke open with his Feet. <hi>Francion,</hi> who that night ſlept ſoundly, and heard not the ſhaking of the bed at all, did awake at this new noiſe, and did ariſe to ſee what the buſineſſe was, and knowing old
<hi>Buiſſon</hi> by his Tongue, he demanded of him for what cauſe he did grow into ſo great a choler; What cauſe, ſaid he, Have I not good reaſon? There is in the next room one of your Servants who hath broken open one of my Coffers. <hi>Francion</hi> replyed, I cannot believe it, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain no Servants but ſuch as I conceive to be very faithfull. Nevertheleſſe let me ſee if that be true which you repreſent, if it ſhall appear ſo unto me, I will afflict upon him the ſevereſt puniſhment my ſelf.</p>
            <p>As he was ſpeaking theſe words, <hi>Buiſſon</hi> called one of his Grooms, who brought him a Candle, and his Daughter having in the mean time cauſed her Lover to hide himſelf under her Bed, did put on her Petticoat, and came to open the door, rubbing her eyes, as if ſhe were but newly awake. Her Father was much amazed to ſee her, and demanded of her, if ſhe heard no noiſe in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Chamber? She made anſwer, No forſooth, nevertheleſſe he ſearched up and down, and came at laſt to look under the Bed, where he perceived her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, whom he knew to be one of his Neighbours. He thought that ſome one had been there to ſteal rather the treaſure of his Coffer, than the treaſure of his Daughters Honour, conceiving, that neceſſity, and not love had brought him thither; The young Gentleman ſaid unto him, Sir, I beſeech you to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the fault which Love hath cauſed me to commit; you know I am not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended of ſo baſe a Family that it will be any diſhonour to you to have me to be your Son-in-Law; Madamoiſelle your Daughter doth not diſdain me, make me then ſo happy that I may have your conſent as well as hers. Monſieur <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſon</hi> would not attend till he had ended his ſpeech, but was in ſo prodigious a choler, that if
<hi>Francion</hi> had not held him by the Arm, he had run his Sword through his body. Sirrah, ſaid he, are you ſo impudently wicked, as to come to diſhonour my houſe, I proteſt unto you, I will make you to repent it; And turning unto <hi>Francion</hi> he ſaid unto him, I pray, Sir, unhand me, and grant me a little liberty, If you will expreſſe unto me any teſtimony of your love, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that I take vengeance on this wretch, who ought to dye by no other hand than by my own. I ought alſo in the like manner to put to death that ungrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous off-ſpring of mine, whom I am aſhamed to own for my child. Dear Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> as long as I am here, you ſhall not doe them any hurt, I my ſelf will be the Advocate of ſo juſt a cauſe as theirs; And having forced the ſword from the hand of <hi>Buiſſon,</hi> who was not ſo ſtrong as himſelf, he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to him, that there was no redreſſe for what had been done, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to authorize it, and if he ſhould doe otherwiſe, there would be reaſon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that the diſhonour which he ſo much feared ſhould fall upon his own houſe.
<hi>Du Buiſſon,</hi> in ſome manner approving of his reaſons, did appeaſe the firſt motions of his choler, and ſate down in a chair near unto <hi>Francion,</hi> who taking him by the hand (in the earneſt of friendſhip) did ſpeak unto him in this manner, My dear Coſen, I love you ſo well, that I will make uſe of all occaſions to give you the proofs thereof. The greateſt which at this preſent I can make apparent to you, is, not to flatter you in any thing, although for the moſt part, men are accuſtomed ſo to doe, following the corruption of the age. I will acquaint you with the defects which you have, not to reproach you with them through enmity, or to increaſe your choler, but for the time to come to render you agreeable to thoſe men of worth whom you doe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe. I will not diſſemble with you, you are too miſerable, and a hard man
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59287:115"/>doth render himſelf odious to all the world, becauſe he doth hide and lock up thoſe goods, which every one ſtands in need of, and which every one doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. He makes no other uſe of them, but only to put them to uſe. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to gain any thing by him, for he doth buy as little as poſſibly he can, and never imployeth any workmen, but when he is in ſuch a condition, as meer Neceſſity doth inforce him to it. He gives no recompence to thoſe who have faithfully ſerved him. His Friends are never well-come to his houſe, he gives them ſuch pittifull entertainment, that he ſhews them the deſire which he hath to ſee them no more. You are the Maſter of all theſe vices, I will not conceal it from you, Conſider, and examine your own heart, with as great a ſeverity as that man ought to doe, who is to judge himſelf. You doe know that I doe not unjuſtly accuſe you. Repreſent now to your ſelf, if you are not miſerably deprived of the greateſt comfort of your life, which ought to be the ſociety of your friends. Doe you not extremely injure your ſelf? for you are oftentimes even ready to periſh with hunger amongſt all your riches, and are ſo afraid to lay forth your money, that you dare not buy that which is moſt neceſſary for life. Nay which is worſe than that, you conſtrain thoſe to diſobey you, who doe owe you all reſpect, and whoſe wills are bound to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on yours. I dare maintain what I ſpeak, that you inforce even your own Children to tread in diſhonourable paths; You have a Son of age to know and ſee the world, and you will not allow him what according to his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he ought to enjoy. You have a Daughter as capable to give love as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, and yet you never think of marrying her, inſomuch that ſhe hath been inforced to look abroad to provide for her ſelf. <hi>Du Buiſſon</hi> here inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted him, and ſaid, I know not who told you that, for it is certain I have had always a deſire to marry her to the Son of a rich Merchant whom I know. Doe you not ſee, ſaid
<hi>Francion,</hi> your miſtake herein? you look after nothing but wealth, and never enquire if he to whom you will give her be agreeable to her or not; but let us talk no more of that, ſhe hath found her ſelf a Mate already. I doe now conjure you, that you will altogether abandon your ſordid humour, and I aſſure you I am come hither for that only purpoſe. I made you believe that I would ſtay here a long time, and put you to great expences, but my

            <p>After this, <hi>Francion</hi> did yet moſt lively demonſtrate to him the foulneſſe of his Vice, inſomuch that the old Signior did begin to abhor it, and did reſolve with himſelf to abandon it, and embrace the contrary Vertue, from whence he hoped, that all the happineſſe in the world would redound unto him, but above all, that he ſhould ſee himſelf honoured and cheriſhed by divers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, whom he intended to oblige unto him by his Bounty.

            <p>It was about Noon, when paſſing by a ſpacious Foreſt, he had a deſire to repoſe himſelf in the ſhade, near unto a Fountain which was in the middle of the Plain. He ſent away all his People into the neighbouring Village to take order for his Dinner, and reſerved only one with him, who was the Gentleman of his Chamber, in the mean time he did lie down upon the graſſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated on the Picture of <hi>Nays.</hi> Some will ſay, that following the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Poets he made this Complaint, which indeed is not much unlike to their ayr in the Romances. Ah deareſt Picture! How many Miracles doſt thou contain? And in how little a room? How can it be that the mixture of ſo few colours can have ſuch wonderfull attractions? Alas! thou art nothing elſe but a Reſemblance, and yet thou cauſeſt in me a real paſſion? I take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light indeed to touch thee, and to kiſſe thee, and I muſt confeſſe I touch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Wood, and yet the ſight of thee doth cauſe in me unparalleld tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſportations. What would become of me, if I might be one day ſo happy as to have her in my Arms, whoſe beauties thou repreſenteſt, the exceſſe of Love and Joy would be ſo great, that I ſhould loſe at leaſt my life, ſince that but looking on thee I have already loſt my liberty? But fair <hi>Nays,</hi> I would I were now dying, ſo that I were but near unto your perſon. There was a Gentleman of that Country in the ſame Foreſt who underſtood his complaints, being hid behind a tree near unto him, and being deſirous to know who he was, did approach unto him from his place of concealment, and demanded of him, Whoſe Picture he had in his hands, to which he made ſuch ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints? Sir (replyed <hi>Francion</hi>) I am ſorry that you have heard what I have ſaid; for if you have never proved the force of Love, You will conceive it to be the moſt egregious folly in the World. The other making anſwer, that he was too well acquainted with the violence which that paſſion doth exerciſe upon humane Spirits, deſired to ſee the picture of <hi>Nays,</hi> and knew ſo well to dive into the heart of
<hi>Francion,</hi> that he got the truth out of it, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the whole deſign of his journey to ſee. <hi>Nays,</hi> and ſaid unto him, Be of a glad heart, ſhe is already arrived at the place to which you are addreſſing your ſelf. I doe proteſt unto you, I have ſeen her, and doe believe her to be the moſt beautifull Lady in the world;
<hi>Francion</hi> enquired further of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman what train ſhe had; he made anſwer; ſhe hath ſuch a train, as a perſon of her quality ought to have, ſhe hath moreover in her company a young Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior called
<hi>Valerius,</hi> who in my opinion is as much devoted to her ſervice as your ſelf. They pretend both to be ſick, and to take for the preſent thoſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for their recovery, but I doe believe they doe not drink the waters which are brought unto them, but doe privatly throw them away, for that is not the water which is expedient for them; you ſay true, ſaid
<hi>Francion,</hi> For <hi>Nays</hi> needs no other water, than to drink of the River of the Paradiſe of Love, which I will give unto her, if ſhe pleaſeth; and as for <hi>Valerius,</hi> he muſt needs take full draughts of the water of the River of Forgetfulneſſe, to cauſe him to loſe the remembrance of that incomparable beauty, which doth not ſhine for the improvement of his fortunes, but will procure his death, if always he will adventure to approach it, as he hath done heretofore.</p>
            <p>Having had ſome other diſcourſes on this Subject,
<hi>Francion</hi> did thank the Gentleman for the intelligence he had given him, and departed to the Inn where Dinner ſtayed for him, and after that, he gave himſelf no reſt until he came to the Village where the fountain was, to which ſo many ſick men did addreſſe themſelves. When he came thither in the cloſing of the evening, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that <hi>Nays</hi> was there with <hi>Valerius,</hi> accordingly as he was informed.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59287:116"/>He enquired for the houſe where ſhe lodged, and paſſed by it in a good equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, as ſhe did ſtand at the window to take the freſh air. He there beheld the beauty which ſeemed to him more wonderfull than that of her picture, for he obſerved there many excellent lineaments, which the Painter had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. <hi>Nays</hi> perceiving him, was as ſollicitous to enquire who he was, for ſhe had never ſeen any Signior, who in ſuch a journey had people to attend him ſo richly habited. Thoſe that ſtood near unto her, being ignorant of him, ſhe was conſtrained to ſend one of her menial Servants to inform her ſelf who he was, and what was his name. He addreſſed himſelf to one of his Lackeys, who (as all the reſt of them) was commanded to ſay that his name was <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander;</hi> for <hi>Francion,</hi> contrary to his firſt intention, was determined through all hazards to follow the Counſel of <hi>Dorini,</hi> by that pretence firſt of all to make tryal of his fortune. At the name of
<hi>Floriander</hi> the heart of <hi>Nays</hi> did leap for joy, conceiving that he, for whom ſhe fetched ſo many ſighs, was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in that Country, according to her deſires.</p>
            <p>She could not, as he paſſed by, obſerve <hi>Francion</hi> ſo preciſely, to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not he was like to that picture of
<hi>Floriander</hi> which ſhe had. She now did burn with a deſire to ſee him, and knew not what to doe to make her ſelf ſo happy. The worſt of all was, as ſhe thought, that <hi>Dorcini</hi> was not with her. It did much afflict her, that ſhe had not any whom ſhe thought capable to be imployed in this great affair, and ſhe knew not how to manage it her ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was a ſtranger, and did not well underſtand the cuſtoms of <hi>France.</hi> Nevertheleſſe, at the laſt ſhe reſolved to accompliſh her deſires, and her Lover having ſo far prevailed, according to the ordinary cuſtom, to give her a viſit, ſhe did lead
<hi>Valerius</hi> in a ring, and did believe, that although he had taken the pains to wait upon her, yet ſhe might uſe the liberty allowed to women, and freely give that place to another, which he hoped to enjoy in her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
            <p>As ſhe was in theſe apprehenſions, a Poſt brought her a Letter, which ſhe unſealed, and found that it came from <hi>Dorini;</hi> Madam, ſaid the Poſt, Before ſhe had the leiſure to peruſe it, wonder not that a Letter is ſent unto you here from <hi>Italy,</hi> which came from
<hi>France,</hi> for I was informed, that there was ſomething in it which did much concern you, and that I muſt make no delay, but bring it to you with all the ſpeed that poſſibly I could, fearing you were not advertiſed that you are more near to <hi>Dorini</hi> here, than in your own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; When he had ſpoken thoſe words, ſhe did let her eye fall on the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where ſhe did read, that her dear Lover was dead. It undoubtedly muſt needs be, that the faculties of her Soul were of an admirable temper, that at the ſuddeneſſe of this unexpected and moſt melancholy news, ſhe did not ſeem to change her complexion, or to ſwoun away.</p>
            <p>That which at that inſtant much conduced to make her paſſe away her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, was, that a ſecond Meſſenger belonging to
<hi>Francion</hi> did repreſent unto her, that <hi>Floriander</hi> having notice that ſhe was in that Village, deſired to have the happineſſe to behold her, and deſired to underſtand at what hour he ſhould not be too unmannerly importunate to wait upon her. Her anſwer was, that at what hour ſoever he would pleaſe to come, his preſence would bring an abſolute contentment to her. This being made known to <hi>Francion,</hi> he made his addreſſe unto her, as her Soul was riddling in theſe ſtrange uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, ſeeing on the one ſide ſhe underſtood that
<hi>Floriander</hi> was dead, and on the other that he was coming to wait upon her. Her Recourſe was to her picture, which ſhe ſo well contemplated, that ſhe perceived that <hi>Francion</hi> was not the ſame
<hi>Floriander,</hi> who cauſed her ſo much to languiſh in the feavers of love. Nevertheleſſe ſhe received him according to his quality, and with a countenance leſſe ſorrowfull, than it ought to be for the occaſion which ſhe had to afflict her ſelf. The firſt words of complement being ceaſed, ſhe ſaid <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59287:116"/>unto him, Sir, You can give me certain Intelligence concerning what I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſpeak; There is in
<hi>France</hi> another <hi>Floriander</hi> beſides your ſelf, Tell me, I pray, if he be dead, as I am advertiſed he is? <hi>Francion</hi> perceiving then that it was unprofitable for him to perſonate any other but himſelf, did inform her, that without all doubt <hi>Floriander</hi> was dead; but he did not know the reaſon, he ſaid, wherefore ſhe ſhould think that his own Name was <hi>Florian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Nays</hi> made anſwer, That his own Servant did give him that Name; at which <hi>Francion</hi> being nothing amazed, did ſay unto her, Truly I underſtand now the occaſion of it, It is becauſe he was a Servant to <hi>Floriander,</hi> and he hath not been long with me; ſo that by cuſtom the Name of his firſt Maſter doth come more often into his mouth, than doth my own.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Nays</hi> demanded of him, if he had any Indiſpoſition in his Body, which did inforce him to come and drink the waters of that place? He being not able to conceal his Martyrdom before her who only could redreſſe it, did ſpeak in theſe words, Madam, You doe me wrong to believe that any other Subject, but the Deſire only to ſee you, did poſſeſſe me with the Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to come hither; Take not from my affection the moſt ſenſible part thereof, and believe that I have no other Grief, but that only which your perfections have cauſed in me. But alas, it is a diſeaſe that hath no parallel in the rigour of it, and which would indeed be inſupportable without the hope that doth attend it. Fair Goddeſſe! what miracles have you produced? There are ſome who ſee the Sun that are not warmed with the Beams thereof. Thoſe who behold nothing but the form of it in a picture, doe feel no heat at all; but I have been inflamed even to exceſſe, in beholding but your picture only. What happy Deſtiny is it which hindereth, that in beholding you now face to face, I am not altogether reduced into aſhes! Was Heaven not ſo favourable unto me, to preſerve me in my firſt Eſtate, to make me ſuffer eternally. Be it ſo, or be it not, you, in the ſpite of the Ordinances of Fate, can reſtore me unto my health, and extinguiſh the moſt violent flames which I doe ſuffer. To this purpoſe I come hither, not to drink the waters of the Fountain, which give a remedy to many incommodities of the Body, but to indeavour to have other waters far more precious, which exerciſe their functions upon Souls. It is your good will and your favours which are capable to aſſwage my paſſions, if their ſtreams doe pleaſe to run down upon them. You ſhall pardon me, ſaid <hi>Nays,</hi> if I tell you (whatſoever to the contrary you pleaſe to allege) that I believe you come not hither for any other thing than to make apparent the wonders of your Merit, which as in all other things, ſo it is viſible in this, that at every word you doe ſhow the flouriſh and acuteneſſe of your eloquence.</p>
            <p>This entertainment of their Diſcourſe had continued longer, if
<hi>Valerius,</hi> who lodged in another houſe, was not come at the ſame inſtant to wait upon his Miſtreſſe. <hi>Francion</hi> then did take his leave of her, having not the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty freely to court her.
<hi>Valerius,</hi> who was ignorant that her Journy to theſe Waters was to procure her a Servant, did purſue thoſe ſubmiſſions which he was accuſtomed to render to her; But although he was dead who held he heart in ſubjection, ſhe would not throw away her affection upon <hi>Valerius,</hi> the Inclination which ſhe had to the French was not loſt. She found attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in <hi>Francion,</hi> which were no leſſe able to overcome her, than were thoſe of the Picture of <hi>Floriander,</hi> and of the Story of his Vertues. She ſaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her ſelf, What a Fool was I until this preſent to fall in love with a Picture? peradventure I might have found that he whom I adored, without ſeeing him in effect, had leſſe perfections by farr than were imputed to him. But how on this choice I cannot be deceived, I ſee moſt clearly before my eys an object worthy of admiration. A Signior of Eminence, of a brave port, and a gallant Spirit, and which is more, enamour'd and hot on me, being fill'd, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, with an exceſſive affection, ſo that I ſhall not gain him with that <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59287:117"/>difficulty and trouble, as I might have done <hi>Floriander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt <hi>Nays</hi> entertained her ſelf with theſe thoughts, <hi>Francion</hi> was poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the like, which tended to love her eternally, as the moſt excellent Lady that ever he beheld. The next day he took an occaſion to walk with her, and did lead her under her arm into a pleaſant and ſpacious garden, and <hi>Valerius</hi> in the ſame poſture, and into the ſame place, did lead a French Lady, who was there at that preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion</hi> reſolved to aſſiſt himſelf with the knowledge he had of <hi>Dorini,</hi> and acquainted <hi>Nays</hi> with the gift which <hi>Dorini</hi> had preſented him after the Death of
<hi>Floriander,</hi> which was her own Picture, thinking there was no man to whom more juſtly he could give it, than to himſelf, who was one of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tireſt Lovers in the world; afterwards with words well ordered, according to the politeneſſe of the Court, he demanded of her, If ſhe would not at the laſt, of her own accord, condeſcend to grant him a more precious preſent, which was, the aſſurance of her affection? Sir, ſaid
<hi>Nays,</hi> very ſpiritfully unto him, I plainly perceive that you are of ſo unbounded a Spirit, that it is a hard task to content you. Wherefore did you not content your ſelf with my Picture which was given you? I believe it was becauſe you would poſſeſſe the Original; Be not ſo covetous, if you deſire to live in quiet. I am not ſo bold as yet, ſaid
<hi>Francion,</hi> as to demand to poſſeſſe you, my Deſire only is, that you will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to acknowledge that you do poſſeſſe me; and following his Diſcourſe, he did take the Picture out of his pocket, and did ſhew it her. It is the ſame, ſaid ſhe, which I gave unto
<hi>Dorini,</hi> but only that it looks a little more dark and diſcoloured. Think not ſtrange thereat, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> It is the tears on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which I have powred upon it in the ſtrength of my paſſion, which hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the life and beauty of its complexion. Your tears I ſaid
<hi>Nays,</hi> I durſt lay a wager then that you did kiſſe it both night and day. <hi>Francion</hi> made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, It is true. For my part, ſaid
<hi>Nays,</hi> I am not contented at it. Wherefore ſo, (ſaid
<hi>Francion,</hi> and ſmiled) Are you more pleaſed that I ſhould kiſſe your ſelf? She repyed, I would not that you ſhould kiſſe either the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; For firſt of all, if you ſhould be ſeen to kiſſe me, it would be divulged, that in ſecret I did permit you ſomething elſe; If in my abſence you ſhould be ſeen to kiſſe my Picture, it would be divulged, that when you are with me, you doe kiſſe me; and from thence there would proceed a more dangerous conjecture. But if I kiſſe your Picture, far from any Witneſſes, ſaid <hi>Franci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> no Inconvenience will arive thereby. I think not, ſaid <hi>Nays.</hi> And if I ſhould kiſſe your ſelf, not any being preſent, ſaid
<hi>Francion,</hi> we muſt alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily conclude, that there can be but little danger in it. I will proceed no further, ſaid <hi>Nays,</hi> on this ſubject, let us talk of things more important; However I will leave it to you to judge, if ſuch kiſſes (though they be never ſo ſecret) do not carry ſome Inconvenience with them: but I will abandon this Diſcourſe, your Arguments are too ſubtle for me.</p>
            <p>As they had finiſhed this, and began ſome other Diſcourſe, they beheld a goodly Troop of Men on Horſeback, in the head whereof
<hi>Nays</hi> diſcovered one of them to be <hi>Ergaſtus,</hi> a
<hi>Venetian</hi> Signior, who had made love unto her. He had heard of her departure out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and fearing that his Rival <hi>Valerius</hi> would carry her in his abſence, and marry her in a ſtrange Country, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with all the ſpeed he could to take the beautifull prey from him.
<hi>Nays</hi> did give him better entertainment, than the hatred which in her Soul ſhe did bear unto him did ſeem to permit. Her diſpoſition was ſo courteous, and ſhe was ſo diſcreet in all her actions, that ſhe made a Conſcience to diſreſpect him, who only to wait on her had travelled ſo long a Iourney.</p>
            <p>There were ſo few commodious houſes of entertainment in that Town, that <hi>Nays, Francion,</hi> and <hi>Valerius,</hi> with their Train, did take up all the Lodgings, <hi>Ergaſtus</hi> therefore could not find ſuch rooms as were neceſſary for him, and <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59287:117"/>was inforced to withdraw to the next Town, which was a league from thence. The two Lovers who were always with <hi>Nays,</hi> were glad to ſee their Rival ſo farre removed, who in his Sute was the moſt importunate, and the proudeſt and moſt ſupercilious of them all, becauſe he had riches and poſſeſſions equal to thoſe of his Miſtreſſe, and did believe that for that reſpect ſhe was obliged to chuſe him for her Husband.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion</hi> (to paſſe away the melancholy which poſſeſſed him, conceiving there were not a few obſtacles in the progreſſe of his Love) did one day walk towards the Fountain where they did drink their medicinal waters. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved divers who for a time had a free relaxation of Spirit, without the leaſt trouble in the world. One one ſide he perceived ſome Men who drank off deep great glaſſes from one quarter of an hour to another. On the other, he beheld others who did nothing elſe but make water. There were Ladies alſo who ever and anon, after ſome ſhort reſpite of time, were conſtrained to emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty their bladders: Amongſt them all, there were very few who had any great or viſible malady upon them; the greateſt part came only either for curioſity or for delicacy. There were alſo ſome Women who came thither on purpoſe to find the opportunity to make their Husbands Cuckolds. Nevertheleſſe
<hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> ſaid, We are too blame to take up the rooms of ſo many afflicted perſons, who know not where to lodge, becauſe that we have poſſeſſed our ſelves of all the chief houſes of Entertainment. It is good reaſon that we ſhould give place unto them: What have we to doe here? If it were but obſerved that we make no uſe of the Medicinal water, it would be preſently ſuſpected that we have ſome extravagant deſign. If <hi>Nays</hi> would be perſwaded by me, ſhe would immediately return, ſince ſhe knows there is no <hi>Floriander</hi> to be expected here; and as ſoon as ſhe were gone we would not fail to follow her.</p>
            <p>Having thus diſcourſed with himſelf, he addreſſed himſelf to <hi>Nays,</hi> whom he found well diſpoſed to remove from that Country, where ſhe could find nothing that might any longer detain her. She demanded of him, what way he was reſolved to take? He made anſwer, She might as well enquire of the Marigold to what ſide it would turn; for, ſaid he, It is well known that it is the Nature of that Flower to turn towards the Sun, and it is not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but that I will follow your fair eyes, the Suns of my Soul, in what part of the world ſoever they ſhall give day unto them. If you go into <hi>Italy,</hi> I wil goe with you; If you ſtay any longer in <hi>France,</hi> I will ſtay alſo there. <hi>Nays</hi> was very glad to underſtand the determination of that gentle Knight, whoſe Company was farr more gratefull to her, than that of <hi>Erga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> or
<hi>Valerius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next morning ſhe reſolved to ſet forth towards her own Country, and theſe three Lovers being advertiſed of it, did prepare themſelves to attend her; inſomuch that being ſeen to travel with ſo brave a train, ſhe was taken for no leſſe than ſome great Queen. In this journey great was the jealouſie betwixt the <hi>Italians</hi> and the
<hi>French;</hi> for ſhe highly preferr'd <hi>Francion</hi> in her favours, and made but little account of the two others: Oftentimes ſhe would invite him to come into her Caroach, and diſcourſe with her on different things, where he always perceived the quickneſſe of her apprehenſion, and the vivacity of her Spirit, which by the reading of good Books ſhe had redeemed from the darkneſſe of Ignorance. It was an incredible contentment to him, that beholding the beauty of his Priſon, he could never repent him of the loſſe of his Liberty. In the mean time, his Rivals being vexed at the favour which he received, did ride ſometimes before, and ſometimes behind, to teſtify in ſome ſort their reciprocal diſdain; nevertheleſſe in the Towns through which they paſſed, they did give her that obſervance, as to take up their Lodgings as cloſe unto hers as poſſibly they could.
<hi>Francion</hi> paſſionately deſired to give <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59287:118"/>them ſome Camiſade, to puniſh them for their apparent raſhneſſe, in lodging their affections in the ſame place with himſelf.</p>
            <p>He communicated his Deſign to one of the Grooms of
<hi>Nays,</hi> whoſe love he had purchaſed by his liberality, and he intreated him to aſſiſt him in the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This Servant being obliged to him, did promiſe him to perform what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was in the compaſs of his power; and, according to his directions, he did repair to <hi>Valerius,</hi> and told him, That <hi>Nays</hi> was overcome with the pains he had taken to wait upon her, and deſired nothing more than to delight her ſelf in his Company; but ſhe could not entertain him as ſhe would, becauſe ſhe had two other Lovers, who were ſo importunate with her, and eſpecially the
<hi>Frenchman,</hi> whom they ought to ſtand in fear of, becauſe as yet they were upon the Lands of his Country, where he had both Friends and Power: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſhe was reſolved to grant him ſome hours of Entertainment, and deſired him to come in the dusk of the Evening, in a habit like to that of her own Servants.</p>
            <p>Having acquainted <hi>Valerius</hi> with this, he addreſſed himſelf to <hi>Ergaſtus,</hi> to give him the ſame Invitation, ſo that they both apparelled themſelves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as they were preſcribed, believing that it was highly neceſſary to keep them from being diſcovered. <hi>Valerius</hi> came firſt to <hi>Nays</hi> Houſe, and as he was knocking at the door, <hi>Ergaſtus</hi> arrived, who taking
<hi>Valerius</hi> for one of the Ladies Servants, demanded of him, if his Miſtreſſe were in Bed or not? <hi>Valerius</hi> anſwered ſomething ſtubbornly, That he could not tell; <hi>Ergaſtus</hi> could not endure his arrogance, and being tranſported into choler, did give him ſome injurious language, whereupon they fell to blows with their fiſts: In this Commotion one came to the Gate with a Candle, by the light whereof knowing one another, they were two of the moſt amazed Creatures in the world, and being confounded with ſhame, they returned by ſeverall ways to their own lodgings.</p>
            <p>Meeting again on the next morning, they had the curioſity to demand of one another wherefore they were ſo diſguiſed; And becauſe they could not conceal that they were infinitely amorous of <hi>Naeys,</hi> and did whatſoever lay in their power to procure her good will, they accounted one unto the other the meſſage they received, and perceived that there was ſome one who had a deſign upon them. They did ſend to ſeek out the Groom, who did bring the meſſage to them, and conjured him to tell them, for what cauſe he had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them both the ſame errand?</p>
            <p>Seeing they could draw from him no other anſwers, but what carryed no probability of truth with it, they promiſed him a great recompenſe; ſo that being tempted partly with that, and partly with the love which he did bear to thoſe of his own Country, he declared to them, that he had done nothing, but by the Counſell of <hi>Francion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At theſe tydings they were reſolved to be revenged, and as ſoon as an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhould offer it ſelf, to pay the Frenchman in his own metal. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they did ſhake hands, and became entire friends, to have the better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to hurt their common and dangerous Enemy, and propounded to themſelves not to proſecute their loves, until they could be acquitted of his Company.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nays</hi> underſtanding the ill will they did bear unto him whom ſhe loved, and fearing that ſome miſchief might enſue; would not look upon him with the leaſt favour, and did forbear to ſpeak unto him, but when neceſſity did oblige her to it. This much perplexed <hi>Francion,</hi> who propounding to himſelf that ſhe diſdained him, it cauſed him to ſend many Letters of Love unto her by her Servants, who at the laſt aſſured him, that their Miſtreſſe did charge them to acquaint him that ſhe deſired not that he ſhould ſend any more ſuch letters to her. One day, as privately as he could, he accoſted a <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59287:118"/>female ſervant of <hi>Nays,</hi> who did wiſh him well, and conjured her by all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Imprecations, to acquaint him with the cauſe of her Ladies diſpleaſure. She conſented to diſcover it unto him, provided that he would promiſe to keep it ſecret. He having made all the proteſtations that ſhe could deſire, ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him, that her Lady ſuſpecting the dangerous enterpriſe of his Rivalls, would not make manifeſt the affection which ſhe did bear unto him, until ſhe was got forth from thoſe unknown places, and ſaw him in her own lands, where ſhe could interpoſe her authority, whatſoever accident might befall. This gratefull news did bring him as great contentment as he poſſibly could imagin, and for his conſolation he began to nouriſh in his Soul a great hope at the policy of his Miſtreſſe, who would make him to languiſh a little in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, to render afterwards her favours the more precious. When they were come into <hi>Italy, Valerius</hi> and <hi>Ergastus</hi> thought they ſhould eaſily find the means to intrap him, as indeed they well might doe. They did proſecute him with extraordinary reſpect, and did not ſpeak unto him, but in the moſt civil Complements of the world. If his Spirit were not at that time entirely poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with the agonies of Love, which cauſed him to think on nothing elſe, he might well conceive that this extraordinary entertainment of his Rivals, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded only out of a deſire which they had, to draw him into their ambuſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does. Being therefore become a ſtranger to his accuſtomed prudence, he took no care of them, and fondly believed that they did bear unto him no leſſe good will in their hearts, than they expreſſed by their words. To recreate himſelf, he was ſeen altogether in their company, becauſe he durſt not ſpeak unto
<hi>Nays,</hi> and he did goe to ſeek them out himſelf in the places where they lodged.</p>
            <p>One morning he did meet them juſt before the Gate of the houſe where <hi>Nays</hi> was lodged, where he beheld a Gentleman with great joy to ſalute <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſtus,</hi> as if he had not ſeen him a long time before, afterwards he whiſpered ſome words in his ear, to which <hi>Ergaſtus</hi> only anſwered by the ſhaking of his head. Gentlemen, ſaid
<hi>Ergaſtus,</hi> turning himſelf afterwards to <hi>Valerius</hi> and
<hi>Francion,</hi> Behold here a fair occaſion which offers it ſelf to content your curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities. The Maſter of this Gentleman is Governour of a ſtrong Caſtle two leagues from this place, he hath heard of my arrival, and hath ſent unto me, to invite me with my company to his Caſtle, you ſhall goe along with me, if you pleaſe, according to his deſire.
<hi>Valerius</hi> made anſwer, that he had never the happineſſe to know that Signior, and therefore he could not believe that he deſired his Company, and for his own part, he was not ſo ill adviſed, as to be importunate with any man, to be obliged to him for a courteſie. <hi>Francion</hi> with greater reaſon made an anſwer, much to the ſame ſenſe. But
<hi>Ergaſtus</hi> ſeeming diſcontented thereat, did ſay unto them, Loſe not the opportunity you have to behold many excellent things. There are great rarities in this place to which you are invited to goe. There are the true Bones of a man of a prodigious greatneſſe. There are to be ſeen all ſorts of Arms, and antient medals, The moſt exquiſite things in all the world are there in one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement to be ſeen. Goe along with me, I beſeech you, for I have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to goe thither without you. I am unwilling to loſe the good opinion of my friend, who may be angry with me for having failed to bring thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to him, whoſe Merit he infinitely doth eſteem. <hi>Francion,</hi> who was not of the jealous humour of that Country, did believe the words of <hi>Ergaeſius,</hi> and that there were many rarities in that place to which he would conduct him, and ſeeing that at the laſt <hi>Valerius</hi> did conſent to goe along with him, he was willing to be their Companion, without conceiving that all this was but a plot laid before hand to take away his life. He was on Horſeback as well as the reſt, and had his Gentleman to attend him, whom he would have had to have followed him, with all his train, but <hi>Ergaſtus</hi> ſaid unto him, that he <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59287:119"/>muſt not be allowed to take any one with him, for they could not be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with any great company to enter into the Caſtle. I take none of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with me, ſaid <hi>Ergaſtus,</hi> no more doth
<hi>Valerius,</hi> it is requiſite that we doe leave them all behind us at
<hi>Nays</hi> Court, After dinner we ſhall eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them; We will have none to goe along with us, but only a Groom of the Marchioneſſes, whom I doe eſteem above all the reſt. Having expreſſed theſe words, he cauſed the Gentleman of whom he ſpake to come unto him, who was the ſame perſon that heretofore was ſo much affectioned to the ſervice of
<hi>Francion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a ſhort time they arrived at the Caſtle, where they were honourably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by him who was the Captain. <hi>Francion</hi> obſerving that they held one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in entertainments, which prolonged the time, was extremely ſorry, for he burned with impatience to behold the marvails that were related to him. He ſoftly acquainted <hi>Valerius</hi> with it, who moved the Company concerning that Subject. The Captain who had the watch-word given him, no ſooner heard of it, but immediatly he took a great bunch of keys, and having led them a long way, he cauſed them to enter into a ſtrong Tower, where, he ſaid, the greateſt rarities of that place were locked up. He ſhewed them a great round chair very ancient, which had truckles under it to move withall. He aſſured them, that on whatſoever hour one ſhould ſit down in it, he ſhould hear a certain harmonious noiſe which came, as is thought, from under the ground, but the cauſe thereof could never be found; It was therefore imputed to ſome Spirits who inhabite the place.
<hi>Ergaſtus</hi> laughed at it, and ſaid it was a phantaſtical imagination, and that he could give no faith to a thing ſo extraordinary; all that ſtood by were of the ſame opinion with himſelf. Make tryal of it, ſaid the Captain, and you ſhall underſtand the Truth, they then begun one after another to ſit down in the chair, and riſing in a wonder they affirmed that they heard the ſweeteſt Muſick in the World.
<hi>Francion</hi> who ſtayed laſt of all, and did laugh at the ridiculous affirmation of his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, did, to comply with them, ſit down himſelf, And the Captain ſtanding neer unto him, did in an inſtant turn a little cord, whereupon the ſprings fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open that held faſt the chair, it did run down with him that was in it into a deep Cave, where he continued for a certain time ſo amazed, that he ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not either hand or foot.
<hi>Ergaſtus</hi> and <hi>Valerius</hi> ſeeing him ſo well ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, did thank the Captain for the good aſſiſtance he had given them, and entreated him to continue it, by putting his priſoner to death, when he ſhould ſee convenient, From thence they departed toward <hi>Nays,</hi> whom they found in a little Town at dinner. She enquired of them what was become of
<hi>Francion,</hi> becauſe it was told her that he was not in that place where all his people were lodged. Her Groom, of whom we have ſpoken, did approach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, and ſaid, Madam, He is privately returned to
<hi>France,</hi> and meeting with me accidentally before his departure, he did give me a charge to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you, that in whatſoever place he ſhould be, he would always aſſume the quality of your ſervant; And Madam, Doe not wonder that he is gone without his train, It is becauſe he would not make apparent the deſire which he hath to depart from you, fearing, that if any longer he ſhould ſtay, it would redound to the prejudice of his affairs; And there is a great apparence that it is ſo, for he hath commanded me to charge his people to return all of them into <hi>France,</hi> and, without making any noiſe, to overtake him in the way. Having told this lie to
<hi>Nays,</hi> he repaired to the Gentleman who waited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Francion</hi> in his Chamber, and cauſed him to depart with all the other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to overtake their Maſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nays</hi> had all the afflictions in the world for the ſudden removal of him whom ſo intirely ſhe affected. Oh, How often did ſhe repent that ſhe had been of late ſo averſe unto him, for ſhe believed that ſhe was the cauſe of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59287:119"/>Accurſed men, ſaid ſhe, ſpeaking of <hi>Valerius</hi> and
<hi>Ergaſtus,</hi> If you had not perſecuted me with your importunities, I had not been conſtrained to uſe him ſo cruelly, whoſe leaſt action doth merit infinite favours. May you be puniſhed with the Evil which you have cauſed me to ſuffer. Never hope that I will look upon you with a pleaſing countenance again. I will for the time to come be more cruel to you than ever yet I have been, or peradventure you doe believe that I can be. And as ſhe ſaid, ſo accordingly ſhe did deport her ſelf; but had ſhe known the treaſon of thoſe two Signiors, ſhe would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly have been inforced to have uſed them more cruelly. At the laſt ſhe arrived at her own houſe, where more and more ſhe did teſtifie her indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and commanded her unfaithfull Groom to ſeek out <hi>Francion</hi> in all places, and to give him a Letter from her, in which ſhe did demonſtrate for what occaſion ſhe did not give him that reſpect which his Vertues did deſerve, and covertly did intreat him to come to that place where heretofore he had a great deſire to arrive. This Poſt did depart to put his charge in execution, and took his way towards <hi>France,</hi> in which he knew well enough that he ſhould not find <hi>Francion.</hi> Having travailed not far, he returned, and before he ſaw his Miſtreſſe, he paſſed by the Houſe where <hi>Ergaſtus</hi> lodged, of whom he demanded what expedient he ſhould uſe in that affair? <hi>Ergastus</hi> believing that <hi>Nays</hi> had never ſeen any thing written by <hi>Francion</hi>'s own hand, did cauſe a Letter to be written as if it came drectly from him, in which, amongſt other things, he did repreſent unto her, that the pleaſures in
<hi>France</hi> had cauſed him to forget the delights of <hi>Italy,</hi> and that ſhe muſt never expect to ſee him again, ſeeing there was nothing that could call him back into <hi>Italy. Nays,</hi> having received that Letter, did call <hi>Francion</hi> a thouſand times ungratefull and unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to write ſuch a Letter to her; But being out of the heat of that paſſion, ſhe could not chuſe but love him as well as before, and was angry with Nature, becauſe ſhe had not given her beauty enough to captivate him who did diſdain her. Her tranſportation was ſo violent, that ſhe reſolved with her ſelf to live always a Widdow, rather than to marry any other but him only whom ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, ſo that both <hi>Ergaſtus</hi> and
<hi>Valerius</hi> did unprofitably continue to render thoſe ſubmiſſions to her, which might have mollified the heart of any other.</p>
            <p>The people of <hi>Francion</hi> travailed many miles to ſeek out their Maſter, of whom they would receive no intelligence. In the mean time he remained in the deep Cave, where he was viſited in the Evening by a Man, who opened the Wicket of the Gate, to give him wherewith to eat. He enquired for what cauſe he was detained Priſoner, and greatly complained of the Treachery that was committed againſt him.</p>
            <p>The Jaylor made anſwer, You are not the firſt whom I have ſeen deceived in this manner, for during the late wars, the chair wherein you ſate hath ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to intrap many gallant perſonages, who by ſeveral ſubtilties have been betrayed into this Caſtle. <hi>Francion</hi> having anſwered, That this advertiſement was uncomfortable, he was left there until the next day, when he was viſited again by the ſame Man, who for eight days together failed not twice a day to bring him meat and drink. He had within him diverſe conſiderations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he did aſſiſt himſelf to mitigate his afflictions. He repreſented to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that it was as well for him to be locked up where he was, than to be at liberty in the world, where it is a folly to look for any true contentment; At the leaſt he was now delivered from the ſight of the enormities of this age, and had the leiſure to nouriſh his Spirit with ſeveral inſtructions of the profoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>The Captain, having not cruelty enough to ſuffer him to dye by languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor to cauſe poyſon to be given to him, which would have a more ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den effect, did determine to grant him his liberty, and ſeeing that <hi>Ergaſtus</hi> was now a great way from him, he did not much mind to put what he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <pb n="16" facs="tcp:59287:120"/>in execution. He one night did ſend ſome men into the priſon where he was, who with all their force did take his cloaths from him, and delivered him to ſome Country-men that were preſent, and having blinded his eys, and tyde his hands and his feet, they carried him to a ſmall River which paſſed by the ſide of the Caſtle; there was a little Boat on the Bank, into which they did put him, and they did permit him to be carried away by the current of the ſtream, the drift whereof did bear him a great way. He could never imagine in what place he was; but by turning himſelf up and down, he conjectured that he was in ſome Beer.</p>
            <p>After that it was morning he was a long time beaten up and down by the wind, becauſe there was no body upon the River; at the laſt ſome men who were comming up the River in a Bark, did meet with this Boat. They imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly ſtopped the Boat, and having brought it to the Bank, they did take the Man out of it, and having unblinded him, they demanded of him, who did put him there? He did anſwer them the beſt he could, making not the leaſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his quality, ſo that he was taken by them to be ſome poor man. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger inforcing him, he was conſtrained to take his Repaſt with thoſe people who belonged to the Neighbouring Village. He had no money about him, and knew not whither to go to borrow any. His cloaths were ſo ragged, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſightly, that he could hardly be taken for what he was, if he had diſcovered himſelf. He knew not where his train of Servants were, and it was impoſſible for him to go to look them out, becauſe he had no Paſſe to travel, neither was he minded to demand one, becauſe he was not aſſured in what place to find any of his people, and he was afraid to go into the Towns, for fear he ſhould meet with ſome who did know him, and ſeeing him in ſuch an equipage, ſhould entertain ſome bad opinion of him; He concluded, that it was his ſureſt courſe to attend a little, until <hi>Raymond</hi> and <hi>Dorini</hi> were come into <hi>Italy,</hi> according to their promiſes: He aſſured himſelf of all aſſiſtance from them that he could deſire, and believed that he might impart his Misfortunes in his Letters to them, in whatſoever place they were; For the reſt, he was well content for a few dayes to keep himſelf in a place where he was unknown, and where he might have the leiſure to digeſt into order an infinite number of excellent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations which he had in the time of his Impriſonment.</p>
            <p>He who had given him his Dinner, ſeeing him of a good countenance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, If he would ſtay with him to keep his ſheep, his Shepherd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead not long before? to which <hi>Francion</hi> did readily agree. And let none think ſtrange of it, that he accepted of that Condition; there was nothing in it which was not worthy of his gallantry. The greateſt men in the world have been ſometimes addicted to the like Condition, to live with the more tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Spirit. The Charge of the Flock being given to him, he did lead them forth into the fields every day, and in the way he ſtudied on divers things he had to write. He compoſed many Verſes in the praiſe of <hi>Nays,</hi> and on the paſſion which he had for her. He alwayes did contemplate on her beauties in whatſoever place he was; and although at the firſt he was much afflicted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that with his cloaths they had taken her Pourtraict from him, he did pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently endure that loſſe, becauſe he had her Picture ingraven in his heart; which did better repreſent her, and ſhewed it ſelf more lively far unto him in darkneſſe, than by day.</p>
            <p>He did one day repair to the houſe of a Gentleman, where he ſaw a little Lute, on which there was not any one who could play. He did demand it of him, aſſuring him, that he knew a little how to finger that Inſtrument; and having it given to him, he found the means to accouter it with good ſtrings, and became afterwards the <hi>Orpheus</hi> of the Village. The Gentleman whom he overcame by his Importunities was nothing ſorry of his gift, after he had heard him to play ſo well thereon. To the Muſick of the Lute he had alſo ſuch good <pb n="17" facs="tcp:59287:120"/>Songs, that his company began to be in great requeſt. On Sundays and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydays he was always at Feaſts, ſometimes at one, and ſometimes at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where he did eat and drink with as much appetite as at the Court, and did laugh as heartily. That which moſt of all did pleaſe him, was, that he did not fear any envious eye to be ſuch an obſerve of his actions, as to make a gloſſe upon them, and to defame him by back biting him. There was no perſon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, that he did not give unto him due honor, and that he exchanged not with him Complement for Complement. He enjoyed an abſolute liberty in whatſoever place he was, inſomuch that he confeſſed in himſelf, that he never did lead ſo happy a life; and he had always kept himſelf in that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were it not that ſometimes he had moſt violent fits of his amorous Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which did inflame him with a deſire to ſee his <hi>Nays;</hi> Nevertheleſſe, when occaſion did ſometimes preſent it ſelf to taſt a little of the ſweet pleaſures of Nature, he was not ſo ſcrupulous as to believe he offended his Miſtreſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. He oftentimes did take his Lute with him into the fields, and the hand ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt and moſt lovely maids of that place would forſake their ſheep to hear him play under the ſhade of ſome Copſe, or in ſome Cavern; Wehn he was alone with any one of them, he did not forget to uſe his beſt indeavours to gain her.</p>
            <p>There was a brown Laſſe amongſt them that did infinitly pleaſe him, but he could not arrive to the end of his deſires, which was to enjoy her, if one day in private he had not adviſed her, after he had done playing with the Lute, that he could play alſo on another Inſtrument ſo well, that ſhe would be even raviſhed with the harmony therof, howſoever he would not have that Muſick to be made known to all the World. She, who took great delight to hear him ſing, did moſt inceſſantly beſeech him, That he would make her ſo happy, as one day to partake of that rare Muſick. I will, ſaid he, provided you acquaint no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy therewith; for I deſire not to manifeſt to the world what I can do. Come to me to morrow to the Wantons Cave, you, without all doubt, ſhall find me there with my Inſtrument, which I will not forget to bring along with me.</p>
            <p>The Brown Laſſe, being as glad as if ſome great Treaſure had been offered to her, did not fail on the next day to come to the place that was appointed, which was unfrequented by the Country people. Well, ſaid ſhe, I ſee you keep your promiſe. He made anſwer, Yes, I am ready to do you ſervice. She thereupon did ſit down cloſe by him, and intreating him, to ſhew her his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, and to play therewith. He ſaid unto her, Sweet-heart, You never ſaw ſo miraculous a thing as I do uſe to produce my melody. To conceal no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from you, I have not my Inſtrument made either of Wood or of Horn, the Harmony proceeds from the Members of my body, which doth produce it altogether. The Maid then imagined, that in uſing certain geſtures, and ſome ſtrange motion of his Body, he had the art to make his bones ſo to crackle, as to make ſome other kind of an agreeable ſound; Or elſe he had ſome melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous knack with his fingers; Or with his hands did ſo ſtrike on the other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body, that there was a certain concent of Muſick in the noiſe which it produced. But ſoon afterwards ſhe perceived that there was ſomething elſe to be done; for he ſaid unto her, Sweet-heart, Since you will have pleaſure, you muſt take ſome pains your ſelf; I cannot exerciſe my artifice alone, you muſt joyn with me in it, and help me if you pleaſe. Shew me then, (ſaid the brown Laſte) that which I muſt do. Immediatly <hi>Francion</hi> did imbrace her, and kiſſed her at his pleaſure; afterwards he endeavoured to accompliſh the reſt. Oh God (ſaid ſhe) you do me wrong! Let me alone. Patience (ſaid
<hi>Francion</hi>) the Event will be better than the Beginning. Immediatly ſhe was ready to ſwoun away with pleaſure, finding I know not what extraordinary ſweetneſſe: And obſerving that <hi>Francion</hi> began to retire from her, ſhe ſaid <pb n="18" facs="tcp:59287:121"/>unto him, What! Have you done already? you have but juſt now begun. Oh my Sweet heart, ſaid
<hi>Francion,</hi> I did truly prophecy that it would not hurt you, and you would deſire that the Melody laſted longer. Truly ſo I do, ſaid the Girl, your Muſick is ſo ſweet that it makes no noiſe at all, one cannot hear it; but one may feel it with delight enough. Is there no way for us to begin again? Dear Sweet-heart, ſaid he, All good things are rare, and hard to be obtained, This is of the ſame Nature; But tell me, and ſpeak truly, Have you not found a great deal of pleaſure in that which I have done? I ſhould have loſt my ſenſes, ſaid ſhe, if I ſhould not confeſſe as much. Some time after that pleaſant entertainment, they had the means to begin again their incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Muſick, which was no leſſe agreeable at that time, than it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>After this, the brown Laſſe did go every day to find out her Minſtrel, as ſoon as ever ſhe could get away from her Fathers houſe; but ſhe was ſo full of tongue, that ſhe revealed her ſecret to one of her Companions, who deſiring to participat in the Contentment, did come along with her to give a viſit to our Shepherd in the Melodious Cave. This brown laſſe did make a requeſt to the Shepherd for her, but at the firſt he ſeemed to ſtand off, and to make ſtrange thereat; and checked her much for having diſcovered that which ſhe had promiſed to conceal. Nevertheleſſe he gave them both ſmooth words af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and ſaid, that he would content her Companion, becauſe ſhe ſhould not vex him with her daily importunities, to have her to taſt of the ſame plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
            <p>The brown Laſſe did deliberate with her ſelf to be gone for a while, to give him the opportunity to play with the other, and thereby ſhe did the Muſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an a great Courteſie, who in one time could not render them both intirely contented. Her Companion ſtayed with him, and making ſome reſiſtance at firſt, as if ſhe was unwilling to endure that which he had a deſire to perform, ſhe proved at the laſt the ſweetneſſe of his harmony. The brown Maid being returned, demanded of her Companion how ſhe found her ſelf? and if it were poſſible to imagine any thing that was more delicious? Truly (ſaid ſhe) I am beholding to you; but in this I find nothing at all which is new unto me: for a Groom of my Fathers did cauſe me to underſtand as much as this many years ago. This Shepherd doth no more than all other men do, nor is he more cunning in his art than they are. Say that it be ſo, (replyed the brown girl) yet I had rather that he ſhould give me this Contentment than any other whom I know, for he is a handſom Man, and I will never endure that thoſe foul Clowns, whom I ſee every day, ſhould approach me as he doth, by putting their bodies and their mouthes to mine. If you take him for that, ſaid the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I muſt excuſe you; for you have the beſt reaſon for it in the world, and the handſomeſt Muſician amongſt them all: But have a Care that his Muſick prove not dangerous to you; for, it may be Nine moneths hence, to your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, another young Muſician may come forth from your Belly, with Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick far differing from his; It will be a young Child, who will do nothing elſe but cry, untill you ſhall give him that breaſt to ſuck which your Shepherd hath ſo often kiſſed; and this is the reaſon why I counſel you as much as I can to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain for the time to come from going to the melodious Cavern.</p>
            <p>The Brown Laſſe followed the advice of her Companion; but
<hi>Francion,</hi> for all that, did want for no Game to ſport himſelf withall: He had many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther female practitioners, as well as her ſelf, inſomuch that he ſeemed to be the Town-bull of that, and all the other places thereabouts. If he found any Girl that was more coy than the reſt, be had recourſe to his old artifices to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome her. I am of an opinion (ſaid he to himſelf) that it is of no great Importance what
<hi>courſe</hi> of life it is we <hi>live,</hi> if ſo be have contentment with it. We ought not to take any care at all from whence this Contentment doth
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59287:121"/>proceed, if it comes according to our wiſh: What occaſion then of ſorrow have I, although of a Gentleman I am become a Shepherd, ſince I enjoy all the ſweeteſt delights in the world? Ought I to afflict my ſelf to obſerve the means I muſt uſe to arrive to the end of my intentions, ſince I ſo happily do accompliſh them?</p>
            <p>Thus did he argue and reaſon on his own fortune, and many voluptuous perſons have the ſame thoughts, without dreaming of the puniſhments that do follow ſo licentious a life. Some having defloured Maids, and got them with child, are by Juſtice conſtrained to marry them, or to ſuffer impriſonment, or to give a round ſum of money to marry them to others; Sometimes alſo the Parents themſelves, being reſolved to be revenged on thoſe who doe diſhonour their Children, doe cauſe thoſe perfidious Lovers to fall under the hands of Aſſaſſinates. Amongſt thoſe poor people with whom he did converſe, <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> was in ſome reputation, and becauſe he had no deſire to continue long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, it made him the more hardy; howſoever, for all that, he ſhould not have indangered himſelf; and as for the Country Wenches that ſuffered themſelves ſo eaſily to be abuſed, they made their weakneſſe and their ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity the more apparent. It is true, that <hi>Francion</hi> had a more generous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and deportment than all the peaſants in the Country, but this ſhould render him to be the more ſuſpected amongſt them, eſpecially becauſe he was a ſtranger. Nevertheleſſe, we muſt confeſſe that Love comes to be Maſter of all manner of Spirits. There was not a Wench in the whole Country but was charmed by the gallantry of this brave Shepherd, and acknowledged that perfectly they did learn by him the whole method, and the art of Love, for all the ſloth, and the clowniſh ſimplicity of their apprehenſions. The Wife of the Labourer with whom he lived, was as much enamoured on him, and indeavoured to diſcover it to him by all the means ſhe could invent. She would let him goe in the morning to the fields, without giving him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to put into his Satchel, becauſe ſhe might take the occaſion to goe her ſelf unto him to carry him his dinner. She took a great pleaſure to pull a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell from his hands, of which he had bit ſome part, to eat it after him. She would doe nothing but play the wanton when ſhe was with him, and with the leer of ſmiling invitation, ſhe would turn her eye aſide upon him, as who would ſay, I even dye for the love of thee. <hi>Francion</hi> did obſerve it well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but he made as though he had not the leaſt thought of it in the world; for this woman did ſo diſpleaſe him for ſome imperfections which he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in her, that he could not but abhor to kiſſe her.</p>
            <p>One day, to dive into the bottom of his heart, ſhe ſmiling ſaid unto him, Thou knoweſt not, on my faith, what a report is brought unto me of thee, which is noiſed over all the Country, it is, that thou are in love with me, and that thou haſt knowledge enough to take upon thee another condition of life than that of a Shepherd, but that thou art glad to take upon thee that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to have the means to ſtay with me. You muſt take no notice, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> of ſuch Informers, they are but Mockers and Detractors; I know well enough that they ſpeak not the truth. Say you ſo, replyed the Wife, why! Is it a thing impoſſible? No, ſaid
<hi>Francion,</hi> but that which dependeth on our will, is not always put into act, although it lyeth in our power. By this defence he ſet her farther off from the mark at which ſhe aimed than ſhe thought he would have done, and he ſeemed not to regard the rowling mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her eyes which ſparkled with luſt in propounding to her ſelf the ſudden fruition of incomparable delights. The next morning her Husband being gone many miles from home, ſhe determined with her ſelf to make uſe of the opportunity, and whiles the Shepherd was in the fields, ſhe took away his Bed, Sheets, and Coverlet, and hid them from him, ſo that when he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take his reſt, finding all things removed out of his Chamber, he came <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59287:122"/>unto her to demand where ſhe intended he ſhould lodge that night. O God, ſaid ſhe, I have carryed up all your bedding into the Garret to have it aired, where it muſt continue two or three days; In the mean time, if you will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to lie quietly, and doe nothing to me, I will permit that you take ſome part of my bed. <hi>Francion,</hi> underſtanding well enough what it was that ſhe would have, refuſed that offer, &amp; ſaid, for two or three nights he would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to lye upon the graſſe in the Grange. She finding that ſhe was fruſtrated of her hopes in her firſt attempt, did reſolve her ſelf upon a ſecond, and brought all the Shepherds bedding down again. About the middle of the night, ſhe did ſit up in a chair ſtark naked, and did begin to complain, and to call the Shepherd to her. He lay in a Chamber hard by, where diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he could hear her, and came quickly to her with a Candle lighted in his hand, to demand of her what ſhe would have. Woe is me, ſaid ſhe, I came now from doing my eaſement, and ſuch a feebleneſſe hath taken me, that I am not able to return to my Bed, ſo that I am inforced to ſit down here, I pray you to take me into your arms, and to carry me to bed, for it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me to put one foot before another. She prononnced her words faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and made many ſtops as ſhe did ſpeak them, and hanged down her head, ſo that <hi>Francion</hi> believed that ſhe was ſick in good earneſt; He therefore did take her up ſo cleanly, that ſhe touched not the ground with her toes, and carrying her to the Bed, He turned his face quite another way from hers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as he conceived, there came an ill ſmell from every part of her body. But ſhe imbracing him with all the ſtrength ſhe had, and ſtretching forth her neck as far as ever ſhe could, did prevail ſo far that ſhe kiſſed his cheek. This Love-trick not pleaſing him, he left her in her ſmock upon her Bed, and ſaid unto her, lye down, and cover your ſelf if you will, I have ſuch a deſire to ſleep, that I cannot ſtay any longer. Go not from the prithee yet, ſhe replyed, I will hire one too morow to keep thy ſheep for thee, and thou ſhalt take thy full reſt for the time which this night thou haſt watched with me. What would you have me to doe? ſaid he. Alas, ſaid ſhe, nothing but to keep me Company. How cruell you are! Come near unto me. He then advanced three ſteeps towards her, and ſhe coming out of her bed did meet him, and did again imbrace him; but his fleſh having an antipathy unto hers, he did thruſt her from him, and ſmiling, ſaid unto her, You are not ſo ſick as you pretend your ſelf to be, if you have any malady, it proceeds only from your fancy, and ſo let it goe for me. In the abſence of your Husband you ſhould deſire no other company but only that of your Pillow. She did grow into a rage to hear thoſe words, yet her diſdain was not of force enough to turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hatred the affection which ſhe did bear unto him. She continued the good entertainment which ſhe was accuſtomed to give him, and endeavoured as much as lay in her power to procure his favour. At the laſt, having a deſire to deliver himſelf from her importunities, he diſſembled that he did bear more good will unto her than heretofore he had done, and becauſe his Maſter was returned, he acquainted her that ſhe muſt take the reſolution her ſelf to come unto him one night when her Husband was aſleep, to paſſe away ſome time in her Company. The Bargain being made, ſhe was the moſt contented woman in the World, and propounded to her ſelf that undoubtedly he would accompliſh her deſires.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Francion,</hi> being not of the ſame mind as was her ſelf, deſired the Swine-heard, and the Herds-man, who lay over the Stables, to come and paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way one night in his Chamber, to ſee a Spirit, who failed not every night to come unto him to torment him. They made anſwer to him, that they would not come, for they had reaſon to be afraid of ſuch beaſts. Come boldly to me ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> you ſhall not receive the leaſt prejudice. I believe it is the ſame Maid Servant which we had the other day, who comes to affright me. <pb n="21" facs="tcp:59287:122"/>Doe you only provide your ſelves with good Rods to whip her ſoundly, that ſhe may have a deſire to return no more unto me. The two Drolls apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that news, were as glad as if they had been invited to a Wedding. They ſtayed in his Chamber, without making the leaſt noiſe, having in their hands thoſe armes which were neceſſary for the execution of the deſign. The poor inamoured Wife obſerving that her Husband according to his old cuſtom was faſt aſleep, did ſoftly riſe from him, and going forth of her Chamber, ſhe did doublelock the door, that, if peradventure he ſhould wake, ſhe might have the leiſure to come away from <hi>Francion,</hi> and not be taken in the Deed, but might perſwade him that ſhe had been at the Privy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion,</hi> who heard her coming, gave order to his Companions to make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy their forces, for the pretended Spirit was approaching. They were not deaf to his advertiſements, for their Miſtreſſe was no ſooner entred into the Chamber, but they took up her ſmock, and did give her ſo many, and ſuch cruel laſhes, that the rudeſt hangman in the World did never ſo whip a Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purſe, that would not promiſe him money to be more gently entreated by him. Perceiving that they were more than one who did proſecute her in this manner, ſhe durſt not cry out, nor ſpeak the leaſt word, for fear of being diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and for the ſhame ſhe had to be taken out of her Bed. At the laſt (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that without any reſpite they ſo continued in their hot exerciſe, and all her body was pittifully torn) ſhe could not forbear from crying out
<hi>Help</hi> and <hi>Murder.</hi> Her Husband being awakened at that noiſe, and in amazement, not knowing from whence the voice did proceed, did goe out at another door of the Chamber, and not at that which his Wife had double locked, and came down into the Court to ſee what the buſineſſe was. At the laſt <hi>Francion,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pitty of his Wife, did take the Swine heard by the Arm, to make him-underſtand that he had done enough. Thereupon he did leave off, and his Companion alſo; She ſtealing away, did open the door of her Chamber, and did lye down in her Bed as before. Her Husband perceiving that there was not any in the Court, did come back into the Houſe, and adviſing with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that, poſſibly, the noiſe which he heard might ariſe from the Shepherds Chamber, he ſoftly did goe thither to know if he were aſleep. The two Companions who held ſtill their rods in their hands, did conceive that it was another Spirit, and having taken him by the Arm, they began to lay about him, as heretofore upon his Wife. He, feeling the ſmart, became ſuddenly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, and delivering himſelf from their hands, did ſtrike them with his Fiſt with all the ſtrength he had. They imagining to themſelves that ſuch heavy blows could not proceed from the hand of a mortal man, did believe that it was truly a Hobgoblin, ſo that they did aſſay to avoid his incounter, and did hide themſelves on the other ſide of the Bed, where they might eaſily have been found, if they had been indeed purſued by a Spirit. Where are you? ſaid the Labourer to <hi>Francion.</hi> He anſwered from his pallet, O my God, make all the haſt you can away, Here are Spirits that do nothing elſe but tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment me. Immediatly in a great fear he departed, and did believe what he Shepherd had told him, and having both locked and bolted his door, he did goe to bed to his Wife, who counterfeited her ſelf to be very drouſie, and did ſay, for her own part ſhe did hear nothing at all. He made a ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and declared only unto her, that he had been whipped by Spirits, who vaniſhed away in a moment. She was glad to underſtand it, becauſe he had a ſhare in the puniſhment as well as her ſelf, and this was ſome kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to her. The Labourer did much lament his poor Shepherd; who was expoſed to the fury of thoſe evil Spirits, and the next morning he enquired more particularly of him what were the torments he had endured. He inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch a number of them, that they drew tears from the eyes of all the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But as for his enamoured Miſtreſſe ſhe was in a great doubt whether they <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59287:123"/>were Spirits or living Creatures who had whipped her by his inſtigation. At the laſt ſhe believed that all proceeded from his invention, becauſe ſhe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in him a great change of the good humour in which he was at the laſt time when ſhe ſpake unto him, when he conſented to give her all content. He preached now nothing but Honour and Chaſtity, and did admoniſh her to be more faithfull to her Husband than hitherto ſhe had been. She was inforced to obey his Inſtructions, although ſhe failed not in her will to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe them.</p>
            <p>After that time (obſerve but the ordinary opinion which men have conſtantly of Shepherds) <hi>Francion</hi> was believed to be a Magician, and that he held a communication with Spirits; Many times the peaſants obſerved that he did talk to himſelf (as he was making his Verſes) and becauſe he had Poetick phraſes which they could not undecſtand, they imagined that he diſcourſed with ſome inviſible Spirit. He had but little conference with thoſe brutiſh people, unleſſe when he had a deſire to laugh, inſomuch that all of them did impute his ſolitude to the cuſtom of his damnable profeſſion. He was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be experienced in diverſe things which are beyond the apprehenſions of Villagers. One day having heard ſome high diſcourſe concerning Prieſts, he ſo expreſſed himſelf, that he cauſed admiration in the ſtanders by, which made them believe that the Devil was his School-maſter.</p>
            <p>By natural Magick he did many gallant things, and cured thoſe that were ſick, ſo miraculouſly, that almoſt every one did conceive that there was ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in it. Moreover, they did believe he had the knowledge to foretell what was to come, and could divine on all things. One time being in the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome Citizens Daughers, and ſome Country wenches, after ſome devices of unprofitable, but inviting mirth (to gain himſelf authority) he ſaid unto them, I will lay you a wager, that I will find out her amongſt you all who is not a Maid. One of them immediatly made anſwer, Your knowledge will be here imployed in vain, for you may well ſay that there is not one amongſt us all in this place who hath loſt her honour. Speaking theſe words her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance did ſomething change, which was obſerved by <hi>Francion.</hi> Beſides that, her redineſſe to perſwade him not to attempt to diſcover her who was unchaſt, did make him to believe that ſhe her ſelf was that perſon. This did the more incourage him to perſecute his deſign, but for fear of giving offence, he would not point her out to all the world, who had loſt her Maiden-head, and he would diſcloſe it only to one of her Companions who was preſent. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did ſpeak it in her friends ear. I have found by my Art, that ſhe who amongſt all theſe Maids hath ſinned by fornication, is the very ſame who did ſpeak laſt of all unto me. I think not ſo, ſaid the other.
<hi>Francion</hi> replyed, There are none but ſhe her ſelf, and he who committed the fault with her that can give an aſſurance of it; but if you pleaſe, you may believe me as well as them. The reſt of the company knew not that which was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him until eight days afterwards, at what time the ſaid Girl was marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Gardner of the Village. As ſhe was in bed, not long afterwards her childing throws did begin to grow upon her, and ſhe was delivered of a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Boy. At the ſame hour the ſame Maid who did know the prophecy of <hi>Francion,</hi> did publiſh it as a miracle, which did highly advance his reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It may be well believed that they did all admire his knowledge, but that which made the matter not ſo bad, as otherwiſe it would have been, was, that the Husband vowed that the Child was his own, and that his Wife would not take a Husband, without having firſt made tryal of him, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen a pattern of the cloath, ſhe might try whether it were good or not, and if it did not pleaſe her, ſhe might freely leave it to other Cuſtomers. It was added to this conſideration, that it was a long time ſince ſhe was of age to make love, and that a Maid is like a Tree which muſt be ſhaken before the <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59287:123"/>fruits be ripe. The next morning <hi>Francion</hi> who ſomething doubted of the truth of what he had ſpoken, did ſing, <hi>So well the Gardner watred had his Ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were ſome who did ſpeak pleaſantly that the Bridgroom was a good workman to have a child the firſt week, but thoſe who expreſſed themſelves more ſeriouſly, were amazed how his Wife could carry her great belly ſo well that it could not be diſcovered, but no doubt ſhe uſed ſome artifice to conceal it.</p>
            <p>The next morning one of the moſt ſtupid fellows in the Village believing there was nothing unknown to <hi>Francion</hi> did ſend unto him, to know who was he amongſt all his ſervants who had ſtollen from him a piece of Pork which he had preſerved in his Cellar? for ſure enough he was, that it was not ſtolen by ſtrangers. <hi>Francion</hi> had at this time loſt the reputation he had gained, if he had not aſſiſted himſelf with a ſubtle invention. He did therefore pull out of his Pocket a piece of a Torch, and ſaid, that in the compoſure of it he had mingled druggs of that Virtue with the wax, that when it was lighted there was none could blow it out, but the thief only who had ſtollen the thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which the diſputation did ariſe. You muſt come (ſaid be, ſpeaking to the ſervants) one after another into this Chamber where I will be alone. I will bring you all to your tryal. Immediatly he entred into the room, and the firſt who followed him being innocent, did not counterfeit, but did blow as ſtrongly as he could, thinking to juſtifie himſelf, and not relying on that which <hi>Francion</hi> had ſpoken, he did blow the Torch out; at which
<hi>Francion</hi> was infinitely amazed, and in a confuſion replyed unto him, My Friend, you ſee what my Torch doth make me to believe, I will ſay no more, doe you goe your way and make not the apparence of any thing, and bid your Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to make haſt in, one after the other. He being gone
<hi>Francion</hi> did light his torch again by the means of a Flint, that by conterition ſparkled out fire. After the firſt, another of the ſervants came, to whom arrived the ſelf ſame fortune, as to the former, and ſo it hapned to the others, for the Torch had no Ingredient at all in it, that could make it reſiſt the force of their breath. Nevertheleſſe thoſe who came forth, were put all to their interrogatories con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what paſſed, but they would not ſpeak the leaſt word in the world, but attended the end of the tryal, and did not ſo much as communicate what was done to one another.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who were in the Houſe would fain have ſeen all the ceremony of <hi>Francion,</hi> but he gave an expreſſe charge that no perſons ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the place where he was, but thoſe only whom he was to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, becauſe, he ſaid, he could not proſecute his enterpriſe but very privately. The laſt whom he was to examine was not ſo hardy as the others, for he had not ſo clean a Conſcience, he did blow ſo ſoftly. that he made the flame of the Torch hardly to tremble.
<hi>Francion</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving by it, that he undoubtedly was the guilty perſon, did goe to look out the Maſter of the Houſe, and told him that he had nothing to doe to acquaint him whether his Torch were blown out or not, but only did aſſure him that he who came laſt to blow was the thief that had ſtollen away his Pork. The Labourer ſent to the houſe where his Servants Wife did lodge, and found that ſhe was then putting into the Pot a piece of that Pork which her Husband had ſtollen. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the crime, and
<hi>Francion</hi> highly commeded for his knowledge, and recompenſed with ſome money, which at that time was very well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to him.</p>
            <p>He afterwards was ſo believed by every one to be one of the greateſt Diviners in the World, that being to travell, and the way very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to find out, he very civilly demanded of a Man (who knew every
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59287:124"/>turn on the rode thereabout) which was his readieſt way, he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no other anſwer from him, but Ha, Ha, you doe well to mock at ſuch poor Ignorant Men as my ſelf, Do you ask the way of me, who know the whole World your ſelf, and all that is done in it? Having ſpoke thoſe words, he left him, and <hi>Francion</hi> meeting with no man elſe of whom he might learn the right way, did wander ſo far out of it, that he was inforced to take up his lodging in a Wood for that Night.</p>
            <p>We have made mention before, that when he made Verſes, he would ſpeak ſo punctually, that thoſe who heard him did believe that he held Diſcourſe with ſome familiar Spirit. His Miſtreſs at the ſame time had the ſame belief: Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhe would ſay unto her ſelf, This young fellow is of a jovial complexion, and inclined to love, I do not well know how it comes to paſſe that he doth refuſe the Courteſie which I have offered him. If I were one of the fouleſt Slutts in the world, yet ſuch a fellow as he is, ſhould be glad, me-thinks, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to have me to abate the beat of his concupiſcence. What myſtery is there in it, that he ſhould ſo much undervalue me? It neceſſarily muſt fall out, that he hath ſome other Miſtreſſe on whom he doth diſcharge the extravagancies of his fourth Concoction, which doth trouble the repoſe of his Spirits, and his Bloud.</p>
            <p>Thus did ſhe argue with her ſelf; but ſhe could not diſcover ſo much as one Neſt amongſt all thoſe Birds to which he was accuſtomed to retire himſelf; for he carried his affairs the moſt privatly in the world. One evening ſhe came ſoftly to him, as he was lying on the graſſe, and in a frolick humor, making a Sonnet which began thus,</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>How laden am I now with bliſs,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>My <hi>Chloris</hi> that I ſhall thee kiſs.</hi>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>He oftentimes repeated that couplet aloud, being not able to finiſh the Stanza. His Miſtreſſe thinking that he did ſpeak to ſome Girl whom he had in his Arms, ſhot forth her diſcontented eye as far as ever ſhe could, to find who was that Maid that was ſo happy; but perceiving not any one near unto him, and that he ſtretched forth his armes in the remembrance of ſome paſſed pleaſures, ſhe reflected on a thought which deſerves to be recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this Story. On the Sunday before, ſhe had heard the Curat affirm in his Pulpit, That there were Magitians who did lie with Devils transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into Women, that were called <hi>Succubae;</hi> She immediately believed that <hi>Francion</hi> had then with him one of thoſe gallant Miſtreſſes, becauſe he pronounced words more amorous than the former, and lively expreſſed all that which can be ſpoken in the full enjoying of a Beauty.</p>
            <p>After that time, ſhe did take no more thought to underſtand with what Woman he aſſwaged the deſires of his youth, and looked not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, but with a horror onely, thinking that he had alwayes a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill at his tayl. And ſhe then believed her ſelf, That it was his
<hi>Succu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bae</hi> that did ſo laſt her, becauſe ſhe had ſo great a deſire to lye with him.</p>
            <p>To reflect a little on theſe laſt gallantries, They were contrived on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole to puniſh Vice. It was well done to whippe this inconſtant Countrey Wife, who forgot the Faith which ſhe had promiſed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and would have her Servant to commit Adultery. It is true enough, that ſhe was diſagreeable, and that her Beauties had not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions enough for the curious eye of <hi>Francion;</hi> but let us not look ſo

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uch upon the Cauſe, the Effect is always good.</p>
            <p>As for the contrivances which remarkably expreſſe themſelves, they <pb n="25" facs="tcp:59287:124"/>may ſerve to inſtruct thoſe who have failed, to make them acknowledge their errors: Such was the tranſgreſſion of the Maid who forfeited her honour; and of the Servant who ſtole that from his Maſter, the theft whereof <hi>Francion</hi> did diſcover. In this the greateſt Criticks will be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to approve his Actions.</p>
            <p>As for the reſt which is here contained, I doe not much lay to my heart their choler or their complaints; for I deſcribe only thoſe Vices which are commonly practiſed, and make mention of no act which hath not been committed; and we may ſee how Ingenious Spirits are deluded, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvented with fond Inventions, when only Ignorants and Ideots are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be ſurprized by them.</p>

            <head>THE TENTH BOOK OF THE COMICAL HISTORY OF
<hi>FRANCION.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is true that the ſtiles Comical and Satyrical, are as profitable as they are delightfull. For your Example, you may here ſee all things repreſented to the life. All actions doe appear without diſſimulation, when in Books more ſerious, there are certain reſpects which doe hinder the Authors from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing themſelves with ſo much liberty, and this is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that Hiſtories are ſo imperfect, and filled more with Fables than with Truth. If we will be curious, as in effect we ought to be, where can it better be expreſſed than here? I am of opinion, that in this Book you may find the French Tongue moſt intire; and that I have not omitted thoſe words which the vulgar doe uſe, which nevertheleſſe is not to be ſeen throughout the whole Book, for in thoſe paſſages which are more immodeſt, we are not allowed the liberty to make uſe of them; nevertheleſſe oftentimes the wantoneſſe of thoſe humble conceits are more delightfull than thoſe which are more high. Nay, which is more, I have repreſented to the life, as much as poſſibly may be, all the humours and actions of thoſe great perſonages whom myſtically I have here inſerted, and my adventures can be no leſſe agreeable than many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which are highly eſteemed. I make freely this confeſſion, for being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by many proofs, it will paſſe with the more authority. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who will read this Book, who underſtand not what it meaneth, believing that to make a Book compleat, we are only to heap words on words, without regarding any other thing, but only clapping in of ſome odd adventures to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the Idiots. Nevertheleſſe I have received ſufficient advertiſements from ſeveral perſons, who ſay that they apply themſelves to underſtand whatſoever is good herein. Some doe diſlike one paſſage, and ſome another, ſo that there is nothing in the whole book which hath not both been praiſed and blamed. If I would I might have done like the Painter who hid himſelf behind his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and having heard the different Judgements of the People, did correct it according to their directions, and inſtead of an accompliſhed Picture, did make it at leaſt a ridiculous Monſter. It is better to leave things as they were at firſt, and expoſe them at adventure to pleaſe whom they may, ſeeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſuch a diverſity of narrations, it cannot be but ſome parcels of them will pleaſe one or other. How is it poſſible univerſally to pleaſe all men? For a letterd man who hath been bred up in the Univerſity doth love to read the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of a Scholar, a mongrell Gentleman who hath had his education only <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59287:125"/>amongſt Doggs and Horſes will not be taken with the ſame ſtory, and will delight themſelves only with thoſe ſubject which have a reference to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and condition. If he who hath an amorous inclination, delights to look upon a ſort of intrigues and delicate devices which are practiſed by paſſionate Lovers, another who only mindeth war &amp; the battail, or a pompous, or a grave diſcourſe will believe all thoſe things to be frivolous; but let us not perplex our ſelves among the fantaſies of other men, but take pleaſure where we find it, and purſue the order of our Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Let us now repreſent that <hi>Francion</hi> is become amorous of the Daughter of a rich Merchant, who came to live for a ſhort time in his Country-houſe with all his Family; And although he deſired to ſport himſelf ſometimes with one, and ſometimes with another, he profeſſed it was without prejudice to the Love which he did bear to <hi>Nays,</hi> and that he might eaſily be pardoned thoſe faults, ſeeing in the calamity into which he was reduced, he had need of ſome diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſolace his Spirits.</p>
            <p>Fortune ſo pleaſed that the Father of <hi>Jocunda</hi> (who was ſhe whom now in his affections he ſerved) did ſend for him to make him in his Garden ſome deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate borders, in which he was very expert, for he had read ſometimes in the books of gardening, and to tell you the truth his Spirit was like a Merchant of every ſort, and at his leiſure was provided with all manner of drugs. He was buſie in the Garden when the Daughter of the Merchant came to him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent her curioſity in ſeeing his workmanſhip. A thouſand times he bleſt the hour in which he did put on the habite of a Peaſant, becauſe he had delighted himſelf with many Maids, whom otherwiſe he ſhould never have approached, &amp; which was more over gave him the opportunity to be ſo near to his <hi>Jocunda,</hi> who had a Book in her hand, on which ſometimes ſhe would look, &amp; ſometimes on the young Labourer. What good book is that, Madam, ſaid he, finding no other ocraſion to accoſt her? She made anſwer, when I ſhall tell it you, what good will it doe you, you will only hear a Name unknown, which will ſeem ſtrange unto you, for you and other Peaſants who ſeldom, or never read in all your lives, do believe that there is no other Book in the world but your
<hi>Manuels</hi> only, I am not, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> of that belief with others, I know there are many ſorts of Books, and there are many good ones which I have read. This is a miracle, ſaid <hi>Jocunda,</hi> But, well, to ſatisfie your curioſity, I will inform you that this is a Book which treateth of the loves of Shepherds, and Shepherdeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Did you ever ſee any ſuch Book? Yes, replyed <hi>Francion,</hi> I aſſure you the peruſal of them is very delightfull, eſpecially to thoſe who are in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as you are, for you are infinitely glad to ſee thoſe delights in effect which are there repreſented to you by diſcourſe only. Oh how much, ſaid ſhe, are you deceived to believe that, for if the patience of my curioſity did not lead me to ſee the end of the adventures which are here deſcribed. I ſhould not have the leiſure to read it all over, for I delight altogether in reality, which I cannot find in any of the Hiſtories in this Book, although peradventure there may be ſome apparences for it. Shepherds are here as Philoſophers, and make love in the ſame manner as doe the moſt accompliſhed Courtiers in the world. But to what purpoſe is this? Why doth not the Author give to theſe perſonages the quality of Knights well educated? He makes them the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of eloquence and prudence, which in men of their condition is prodigious. A Hiſtory true or ſabulous ought to repreſent things as near to Nature as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may be, otherwiſe it ſerves but as a tale only to entertain Children in a Chimney Corner, and not ingenious ſpirits whoſe apprehenſion pierceth through all things. We may ſee here the method and order of the world turned topſie turvy. I could wiſh that one or other would make a Book of the loves of Knights, and cauſe them to ſpeak like Clowns, and to deport themſelves in that ſimple manner as they doe in the Country. It will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59287:126"/>no more ſtrange than this doth, which is directly oppoſite unto it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion,</hi> perceiving by her Diſcourſe that ſhe was one of thoſe brave Spirits which he had been accuſtomed moſt paſſionatly to court, was the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Man in the world to lodge his affections in ſo worthy a Subject, and not to loſe the occaſion to entertain her, he did ſpeak unto her in theſe words, That he was much defective in his judgement, who would not approve the reaſons which ſhe did allege. And I do confeſſe, ſaid he, that you can take no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in reading of that Book. Howſoever, I can aſſure you, that in theſe Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges there can ſometimes be found ſome as able to make love, with as much ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villity, prudence and diſcretion, as thoſe who doe live in the moſt flouriſhing Courts of the World. The example (ſaid <hi>Jocunda</hi>) is ſo rarely ſeen, that it will never make up a number ſufficient to authorize my Book of Shepherds. Well, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> and ſmiled, I my ſelf can aſſure you that you ſhall find here in this Country, Shepherds who are accompliſhed Lovers; and for my ſelf, who am a Shepherd, (I will ſpeak it without vanity) if I ſhould be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred in the ſame rank with them, I would deport my ſelf without the leaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſte. I make no doubt of it (anſwered <hi>Jocunda</hi>) but it would then be very difficult for you to find a Country Maid of your temper; there are none here but very coarſe and homely Creatures. You ſpeak of the Country Girls, ſaid <hi>Feancion,</hi> For my ſelf, I throw not my eyes upon them; but here are others who are not onely worthy to be beloved by an accompliſhed Shepherd, but alſo by a moſt accompliſhed Courtier. And I am well able to maintain this Diſcourſe, becauſe I have the happineſſe to ſee you. Oh God! ſaid <hi>Iocunda,</hi> Truly I have been much deceived until this preſent; for I thought that flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers were no where to be found, but at the Court only: but you can flatter here as much as they do there.
<hi>Francion</hi> replyed, Truth is ſpoken by all. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunda</hi> did then leave him, to keep her Mother Company, who walked alone. She was aſtoniſhed to hear a Shepherd to diſcourſe ſo well, &amp; many times believed that it was a Dream; but her Admiration did far more increaſe, when ſhe heard him about ten of the clock in the Evening, to ſing and play on his Lute under her window. She knew who it was by ſome words in his Song, where he did beſeech her not to deſpiſe the Shepherd to whom ſhe had ſpoken. It was a thing which did appear unto her to be truly wonderfull, that a Man of his Condition ſhould make ſo good Verſes as were thoſe which he rehearſed; and moreover, that he did ſing and play on the Lute, as well as the Maſters that made profeſſion of it.</p>
            <p>The dull Peaſants to whom theſe perfections had been ſhown, did not ſo much admire him, as ſhe did, whoſe excellent Spirit was known in all things. But all this was nothing to the worth of the Letter of Love which the next morning ſhe received from him; where ſhe found all the richeſt Flowers of Eloquence. He uſed no other artifice to have it conveyd to her hand, but to put it in a little basket made of Ruſhes, which a young Girl did preſent unto her, as it were, in the minority of her Duty.</p>
            <p>Her Spirit was in great unquietneſſe what ſhe ſhould do in the purſute of her new Lover, whoſe Condition was no wayes pleaſing to her. If his Merit had not qualified her diſcontent, ſhe would not have been pleaſed at his boldneſſe to ſend a Letter of Love unto her. She had a great deſire to underſtand where he had been brought up to ſo many qualities of a Gentleman. And this was the Cauſe that ſhe did go forth alone at the back-door into the adjacent fields, and permitted him the liberty to ſpeak unto her, having met her in a place not farre from her Fathers houſe, where he did feed his flock.</p>
            <p>After that he had given her the time of the day, and witneſſed the joy he received to have ſo happily incountred her, ſhe ſaid unto him, Gentle Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, I do believe, that to pleaſe me you will now give me the proofs of that <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59287:126"/>which you have told me, that you are as accompliſhed a Lover, as any who have their being in the City or the Court.
<hi>Francion</hi> replyed, It is not any delight I take to be a Shepherd, but a Neceſſity that doth conſtrain me to this Condition of life. I cannot believe that, ſaid <hi>Iocunda. Francion</hi> replyed, There is nothing more true, than that your Beauties have the power to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me into any thing, I ſhould be ſorry that any other Subject than the moſt beautifull one in the world, ſhould cauſe me to diſgrace my ſelf into the liberty to do what I have done. I know well enough that the baſeneſs of my Conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth much hinder me in the obtaining of your favour. I do therefore uſe my utmoſt endeavour to repair that defect by mine exceſſive affection, with which I hope well to deſerve it. <hi>Iocunda</hi> ſmiling at this diſcourſe, as in ſome diſdain of him, did immediatly change the compliment, and demanded of him, where he had been bred up. He promiſed her, that on the next day, if ſhe pleaſed to take the pains to come to the ſame place, where he then was, he would declare unto her all along that which ſhe deſired to know, having at that preſent no deſire to ſpeak unto her concerning any thing of which he had not before deliberated with himſelf according to the Rules of exacteſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Staying a little longer with him, ſhe informed her ſelf of divers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. She told him in what a wild fame he lived over all the Country, and that the Peaſants bad almoſt cauſed her to believe, that he had gained by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick art thoſe perfections which he had.</p>
            <p>The day following they came both to the appointed place;
<hi>Iocunda</hi> challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Francion</hi> of his promiſe, which he readily accompliſhed, ſpeaking to her in this manner, If you ſhould not have intreated me to relate unto you who I am, it were neceſſary that of my ſelf I ſhould inform you, if that I do deſire that you ſhould regard the affection which I do bear unto you, I therefore do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto you, That I am a Gentleman of one of the moſt Noble Families in <hi>France,</hi> and having ſome times ſince ſeen you in the City where you are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to live, your attractions did ſo vanquiſh me, that I reſolved with my ſelf to take the habit of a Villager, knowing that you were comming hither, that ſo I might made my ſelf known unto you without giving ſuſpition unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Having recited this Fiction to her, to oblige her the more to reſpect him, he inchanted her with a thouſand proofs of an extreme love; And ſhe not doubting but that he was of great qualitie, did not fail to aſſure him, that the pains he had taken ſhould be well recompenced, and although he was in that ruſtick habit, yet he had the apparence of a gallant young Man, inſomuch that ſhe did bear almoſt as much affection to him, as if he had been covered with the richeſt apparel that the greateſt Courtiers do wear.</p>
            <p>The aſſurances of reciprocal love being given on one ſide and the other, they diſcourſed afterwards on divers particulars.
<hi>Iocunda</hi> related to <hi>Francion</hi> many bold ſtories, by which the Country people would have perſwaded her that he did practiſe the black art, but <hi>Francion</hi> who would not deceive her, as he had done the ignorant Peaſants, did make known to her the greateſt part of the Cauſes for which theſe Rumors were diſperſed amongſt the multitude, and ſhe received much contentment at the pleaſant relation of them.</p>
            <p>The hour of their departure being come, before they did bid Farewell to one another, they deliberated with what Inventions for the time to come they ſhould aſſiſt themſelves, becauſe that <hi>Iocunda</hi> could not come every day out of her Fathers houſe to ſpeak with
<hi>Francion,</hi> but one or other would be apt to ſuſpect &amp; diſcover their affairs. She determined therfore to counterfeit her ſelf ſick, to give an occaſion to her Lover to come unto her, who (according to the Vulgar opinion) could give a ſuddain Remedy for all manner of maladies. This being reſolved upon, they took leave of one another, and returned to their habitations.</p>

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59287:127"/>
               <hi>Jocunda</hi> on the ſame day did begin to put her deſign in execution, and complained to her Mother that ſhe began to be grieved with the cholick. Her Mother no ſooner heard of it, but ſhe pittied her with her heart, ſhe flattered her with her Tongue, ſhe ſtroaked her with her hand, and cauſed her to lie down upon the bed. If there had been any Phyſicians near unto her, they had immediatly been ſent for. Before any thought was had of <hi>Francion,</hi> the Tenant who farmed the houſe of her Husband, ſaid unto her, that it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for him to ſend for him to give her Phyſick; The Father of <hi>Iocunda</hi> did reply, that he would not truſt the life of his only child to ſuch a Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banck. Why ſay you ſo, ſaid the Farmer, do you fear that he cannot as well recover your Daughter, as he hath cured all other perſons, to whomſoever he hath given Phyſick? Believe me he is a Devil incarnate, I know not that thing which he is not able to perform; He knows more than the Curate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of our Pariſh, and at his pleaſure can decline <hi>Victus</hi> over him. The Father of <hi>Iocunda</hi> giving credit at laſt to the aſſurances of many perſons concerning the knowledge of <hi>Francion,</hi> did conſent that he ſhould be ſent for. After he had ſeen the ſick perſon, and felt her pulſe, he took a little Viol out of his Pocket, in which he had a certain O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l which he warmed, and dipped a linnen cloath in it, to put it upon her ſtomach. The hour was ſo favourable to him, that at that time there were not any nere unto the bed, ſo that pretending to apply his remedy unto her, he took the boldneſſe to feel her breaſts, And that it might be believed that he had extraordinary experience in all things, ſhe not long afterwards told her Mother that ſhe found her ſelf in much eaſe, and ſeemed to have a great mind to be merry. Turning therefore to the Shepherd, ſhe ſaid unto him, Shepherd, I have heard it reported that you do play well upon the Lute, ſhall I have that power over you, as to intreat you to give me a leſſon, or two.
<hi>Francion</hi> replyed, you have an abſolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over me, although I know I am not able to give you any pleaſure by playing on my Lute, howſoever I will uſe the beſt Art I have, rather than fall into a diſobedience to your commands. He would have gone for his Lute him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but they would not put him to ſo much trouble, and ſent one of their Grooms to his lodging for that purpoſe, when he began to touch his Lute, all the world were raviſhed at the harmony of it, and eſpecially <hi>Iocunda.</hi> Her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother deſiring nothing more with greater paſſion than her health and contentment, obſerving that ſhe took delight in the Muſick of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, did invite him to come the next day to paſſe away the time with her. They were then abroad to take care for the affairs of their Husbandry, and this was the time in which <hi>Francion</hi> had the leiſure to teſtifie his Love unto his Miſtreſſe, and ſhe was ſo much overcome, that ſhe made a promiſe to him to ſatisfie his deſires.</p>
            <p>They found in the fields invitations enough wherewith to delight and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves, but that Evening <hi>Iocunda</hi> returned with her Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the City. All things there did ſeem to be quite contrary unto her deſign, for the houſe had high Walls on both ſides, and the gates were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways locked, She did write to <hi>Francion</hi> who ſtayed in the Village, in what a ſtrait priſon ſhe was locked up, and aſſured him that nevertheleſs, if he could by any means come ſecretly to her with the Wagoner of their Village, he ſhould for his part receive the beſt entertainment that he poſſibly could expect. <hi>Francion</hi> ſtud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died a while what he had to do, and at the laſt concluded on this invention. The Waggoner of the place ſome few days afterwards was to carry Hay to the Merchants houſe, he reſolved to hide himſelf in the Waggon, and in the mean time, he in a Letter acquainted <hi>Iocunda</hi> with the deſign he had. The Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goner was of a ſimple and dull diſpoſition, and
<hi>Francion</hi> made him believe what he pleaſed. My honeſt Friend (ſaid he unto him) you know that I am very curious. I have heard often a report of the beauty of the houſe in which your Maſter dwelleth in the City, I have a great deſire to ſee it, but I know <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59287:127"/>not which way in the world to give my ſelf that contentment, but only by your means, you muſt carry me thither in your Waggon; I will, ſaid the Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goner, with all my heart, for <hi>Francion</hi> was one of his beſt friends, becauſe he often would make him drink at his Maſters houſe, and in other places; Doe you come to me, ſaid he, when I am to goe, you are known ſo well, that I believe they will not ſhut the Gates againſt you. I am known too well, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> and that is the reaſon why I will not goe in that manner as you doe ſpeak. I would ſo go that not any one might ſee me, for I have a great deſire to obſerve the platform of the houſe, and to take from thence a modell, which in ſome other way may be beneficial to me; but your Maſter muſt know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of it, I am adviſed to hide my ſelf in the Hay, which you are to carry thither, it will be a happy means to accompliſh my intention; I like well of it, ſaid the Waggoner, and it ſhall not be my fault if you put it not in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. For the reſt, when we are to come back, I will pluck the leaves from the Vines, that you may the better paſſe undiſcovered. It will be well done, ſaid
<hi>Francion,</hi> provided that you doe keep your promiſe. The Waggoner aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him of his fidelity, and the hour being come to carry his Hay, he adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed him that he was ready to drive away. <hi>Francion</hi> having delivered his Flock to ſome other to keep, and being accommodated with the beſt habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the place could afford him, did goe to meet the Waggoner, and found him according to his wiſh in a Lane, where he had the leiſure to hide himſelf in the Waggon, that no man might perceive him. In the Evening he arrived at the houſe of <hi>Iocunda.</hi> The Waggoner taking out all the Hay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, did cauſe <hi>Francion</hi> to hide himſelf in a private place, where he did lock him up, which was unadviſedly done both by the one and the other, For if they had been perceived, it would have been reported that they had a deſign to have robbed the houſe, and it might ſo have fallen out that they might have ſuffered for it by the hand of Juſtice. But <hi>Francion</hi> was reſolved to make tryal how far his good Fortue would extend.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Iocunda</hi> was in the greateſt inquietudes in the world, not knowing whether he was come, or not, She could not find any means to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in the truth thereof, for it was not diſcretion ſhe thought to enquire of the Waggoner for him, fearing thereby to give him any cauſe of ſuſpition, and ſhe her ſelf was in doubt if her Lover had hid himſelf in the Hay, or not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his knowlege. At the laſt, all the world being retired, ſhe did repair to the place where he was, knowing that he could no where elſe ſo privately conceal himſelf. He was already gone forth from his place of retirement, to become his own Scout, when ſhe came into the room with a Candle in her hand, and knew him, We need not to demand if they did kiſſe at their firſt ſalutations. They embraced each other above half an hour, with ſo exceſſive a Joy, that it took from them the uſe of their Tongues. Being come out of this extaſie, they deliberated with themſelves where they ſhould paſſe away that night. <hi>Iocunda</hi> was unwilling to bring <hi>Francion</hi> to her own Chamber, fearing he might be perceived to goe up the ſtairs, or that ſome other misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune might arrive. They continued therefore in the ſame place where they were, and <hi>Francion</hi> did ſpread abroad the cloath that covered the Mule upon the Bottles of Hay, that no duſt or other inconvenience might annoy his Miſtreſſe that lay on them. We may eaſily believe that they took as much pleaſure on that hard lodging, as if they had been lying on a Bed of Down. During one of the truces which they made in their amorous war,
<hi>Francion</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her the fine invention with which he had abuſed the Waggoner, who was gone to ſleep in another part of the houſe, believing that he intended to paſſe away that night in the Court, in beholding the beauty of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings by the light of the Stars. <hi>Iocunda</hi> on the other ſide acquainted him, that (not to lye that night in her Mothers Chamber as her cuſtome was) <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59287:128"/>ſhe pretended the immoderate heat of that ſeaſon, to the end that ſhe might be permitted to lie alone in a little Chamber which had a door that opened into the Court, by which ſhe might come unto him, without traverſing the length of it. Taking care for the time to come, they propounded divers ways to themſelves, how afterwards they might ſee one another, as the Spirits of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are ſubtle to apprehend that which may render their pleaſures more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>The beſt Invention which they found, and that which they determined to follow, was, That <hi>Francion</hi> ſhould put himſelf into ſome Merchants ſervice, who, underſtanding his merit, would be glad to make choice of him, and to imploy him for his Factor ſooner than any other:
<hi>Iocunda</hi> conſented that it ſhould be ſo, attending the time that he ſhould diſcover himſelf who he was, and he accorded to retire himſelf from the Village, where he began to diſtaſte thoſe dull, yet uncertain Spirits; howſoever, he deſired not to continue in the Condition of a Merchants Factor, but for a time only. He acquainted his Miſtreſſe that he had need of mony, and ſhe gave him all that ſhe had, being not able to deny him any thing. He partaked with her in all the delights that could be imagined, when not long afterwards, behold a little Star, the Van-Currier of the Day, did give unto them a ſign to retreat. At that inſtant, as they were taking leaves one of another, there was a man who knocked very violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the great Gate, and immediately one of the Porters who was awakened at the noiſe, did come to open it. The man being in arms, did ſay arrogantly unto him, Friend, Go and advertiſe thy Maſter that there is a great Tumult in the City, and demand of him, If it be not his pleaſure to ſend forth a man with a Musket into the Market-place, according to the Commandment which I give you from my Captain? Make haſt unto thy Maſter; Run I ſay, I will attend his anſwer, Fear not that any ſhall enter in, I will guard the houſe my ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Porter immediatly did go up to his Maſters Chamber, and knocked at the door as loud as he could; but becauſe he was faſt aſleep, the door could not be opened. In the mean time the Corporal at the gate, who was one of the Citizens, and in his own conceit more glorious than
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> to ſee himſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipped with other arms than his own, which were a pair of Cizzers and a gooſe, did begin to kindle red with Impatience to attend ſo long at the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants gate, becauſe he had buſineſs in other places. He did grow into a rage, and alleging that they did not give him that reſpect which was due unto him, he did begin to ſwear like a Nobleman; and perceiving that although he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led never ſo loud, no anſwer would be given to him, he did go away full of ſpight and indignation; proteſting that the Maſter of the Houſe ſhould ſoundly pay for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iocunda</hi> durſt not as yet return unto her Chamber, for fear the Porter, or ſome one elſe ſhould meet her in the way. She conceived ther was a fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for <hi>Francion</hi> to be gon, becauſe the gate was open; for whatſoever deſign he had otherwiſe, it would be a hard task for him to convey himſelf ſo ſecretly into the Waggon that no body could perceive him. He did approve her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail, and at that inſtant he did ſet forward to traverſe the Court: when he was on the great Cauſey which did lead unto the gate he had ſo violent a fear, that the Groom comming down the ſtairs ſhould deſcry him, that he began to run with all the force he had, to be the ſooner out of the houſe; But not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the threſhold at the gate was very high, he lifted not up his legs as he was to paſſe over it, wherefore he fell all along, and thought that at once he had broken both his leggs and his arms.
<hi>Iocunda</hi> who ſaw him fall, was very ſorry for it; nevertheleſſe ſhe durſt not approach to his relief, but did repair to her own Chamber, where ſhe did go to bed, and the next Noon complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of her exceſſive Sloth, as if ſhe had ſlept away a whole night, and half a day together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59287:128"/>
               <hi>Francion</hi> did riſe, but not without much pain, and being hardly able to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold himſelf, he leaned againſt the Wall as he paſſed by it. He did well to be gone; for the Groom, having received a charge from his Maſter to go with his arms to the Market-place, did come forth immediatly after him. He did walk as well as he could, but it was ſo faintly, that at every ſtep he was ready to fall down on the ground, when at laſt caſting his eyes towards the ſtreet, he perceived a Chair with Elbows, from whence he ſaw a Man to riſe, who, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he appeared as lame as himſelf, yet he did make haſt to be gone with all the ſpeed that poſſibly he could. Truly (ſaid he) I ſhall not be ſo diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, nor ſo proud as you are, I willingly will ſit down and reſt my ſelf in that chair, if once I can come to it. Having ſpoke thoſe words, he did inforce himſelf to approach unto it, and ſo much prevailed, that he came to it, and ſate down on a ſoft Cuſhion, which at that time was not unwelcome to him.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Francion</hi> is there reſting himſelf, I muſt account unto you who he was whoſe place he poſſeſſed. He was an old Man, full of the Gout, &amp; the moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked one in the whole City, or peradventure the Country, although it ſwarmed with ſuch Companions. It was his deſign to plant diviſion amongſt all, &amp;, if he could, amongſt the greateſt Perſonages. He had a plot at that time upon the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, who not long before was inveſted with the government of that place, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had more reaſon to reverence, ſeeing that not one in the whole City com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of him; But the only Cauſe was, that he had always a wretched diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſpeak evil of Magiſtrates. It was known well enough, that he only did detract him, to follow his old and vicious Cuſtom; For he had never ſo much as once ſeen him, &amp; had ne'r heard of any of his actions, whether they were good or evill. The faults which he imputed to him, were thoſe which he had obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in other Governors: He conceived, that being of the ſame quality, he muſt partake alſo of the ſame Imperfections. It is true, he had great familiarity with a Perſonage whoſe Authority was not to be diſputed of; And to beget in him an enmity againſt the Governor, he one day informed him, that he knew this Governor to be one of the moſt treacherous perſons in the world; he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſign to deliver up the City to a Stranger. This accuſation of the gouty Old man was believed as an Oracle, becauſe he did know ſo well to diſguiſe his wickedneſſe, that one would take him to be a Man filled with all prudence. He moreover affirmed, that he had heard by divers Citizens of ſome pernitious deſign that was on foot.</p>
            <p>It ſo hapned, that the Governor, for ſome particular &amp; good deſign, had that evening been in all the Streets of the City with his Guard. He who received the advertiſement of his malicious perſon, did obſerve it, and infallibly believed that he had a deſire to accompliſh ſome bad Intention; Wherefore, having aſſembled the greateſt part of the City, and declared to them what he heard, he took counſel with them to exhort the reſt of the Citizens to be armed, &amp; to ſtand upon their guard to prevent the Miſchief that was to come. In the ſeveral quarters of the City they were commanded to repair to the <hi>Corps de Guard,</hi> ſo that all was in a tumult. The Governor hearing this, was come forth more ſtrong and better accompanyed than before, to underſtand for what cauſe they did ſo riotouſly aſſemble themſelves, without his particular Inſtructions. If the fury of the People had not been reſtrained by the wiſedom of ſome amongſt whom the falſe Report of this Treachery was ſpred, they undoubtedly had thrown themſelves upon the Governour, and cut him in pieces. The gouty old man, to excite them thereunto, did ſtand at his Window, and cryed out, <hi>Liberty, Liberty,</hi> Gentlemen hang up that Wicked man, who would ſell your Fortunes and your Lives at once: But the voice of the wiſeſt Magiſtrates ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more power than his own, did tie up the hands of the moſt mutinous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59287:129"/>The Governor had notice of it, who teſtified nothing but his intire affection to the publick; Nevertheleſſe ſome of the Inferiour Officers, who troubled every quarter, did ſtill perſiſt to advertiſe the Citizens to ſtand upon their guard, deſiring that every one might partake in the Combuſtion. One of theſe men was come to the houſe of the Merchant, as before I have mentioned.</p>
            <p>The Governor at laſt, who underſtood of the Seditious exhortations of the gouty man, and was fully advertiſed that it was he who had kindled the fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the people, was reſolved to ſend for him, to chaſtiſe him according to his deſert. This Commiſſion was given to two of his people, who had been at his houſe, to acquaint him that their Maſter underſtanding that he was a man of a pregnant apprehenſion, and mature Counſel, deſired that he would come to him, to aſſiſt him in giving ſome reſtraint unto the Commotion of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He would believe nothing at the beginning, but they made ſo many ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous proteſtations to him, that at laſt, conceiving to himſelf that the Governor knew nothing of thoſe words which he had ſpoke againſt him, he flattered himſelf with a belief, that poſſibly it might be that he would be glad to aſſiſt himſelf with his adviſe. Propounding then unto himſelf the welfare and the honour which thereupon would redound unto him, he reſolved with himſelf not to refuſe his Invitation. He thereupon permitted that the two men ſhould put him in an Elbow chair, which they had brought for that purpoſe, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly he ſuffered himſelf to be carried to that place, whither they could never have brought him but by force. They had carried him a great way, when a Citizen by chance did meet with thoſe who carried him, and ſpake ſoftly in the ear of one of them,
<hi>The Governour is not now in the place where you left him, he is gone to the Caſtle, conduct the old Knave thither:</hi> He, who had better ears than they conceived, did readily underſtand thoſe words, which cauſed him to conjecture ſome ſiniſter event did attend him. Before they did carry him reſpectfully as a man of State and Quality, but they now conceived that he ſhould not be ſo well intreated when he was to come to the Caſtle of the City; Nevertheleſſe he ſate very quiet in the Chair, and knowing that all the words in the world were unprofitable in his misfortune, he pretended to fall faſt aſleep, and began to ſnore. His bearers being not accuſtomed to carry ſo heavy a burden, had their arms extremely wearied, and in great drops their ſweat did abundantly fall from their faces; ſo that being at the corner of the ſtreet where <hi>Iocundaes</hi> Father lived, it being an unfrequented place, they had a deſire to repoſe themſelves, and being gone into a houſe of Reſort to quench their thirſt, they drank a draught or two extraordinarily, imagining that the man would not ſo ſuddenly awake, and if he ſhould awake, he would never have the deſire to run away; or if he had the deſire, yet he had not the power to put it in performance, his leggs being ſwollen with the Dropſie, and his feet and toes tyed into knots by the Gout; but they were deceived, for they no ſooner were departed from him, but he knew well enough how to uſe his limbs, fearing the anger of the Governor, and left that place empty, which <hi>Francion</hi> filled.</p>
            <p>The two Conductors having drank ſufficiently, did return to their Office, and did not conſider whether it were the right man or no who was in the Chair, becauſe there was a Curtain about it, by the means whereof
<hi>Francion</hi> was concealed; for they could ſee nothing of him but the tops of his toes. They undertook their charge again, and brought him away chearfully, the Wine having given new forces to them. <hi>Francion</hi> ſaid not a word, fearing to ſtop them, and being very glad to be carried into any place whatſoever, becauſe he could not travel on foot by reaſon of his late bruiſes. He ſaid within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Theſe Fellows, no doubt, will carry me to the Hoſpital, inſtead of the ſick man that is run away, It is no great matter, I ſhall do better there than in the <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59287:129"/>ſtreets, where my feebleneſſe would conſtrain me to continue. If my fall hath done me any harm, I ſhall have there the advice of the Chirurgion. The men carryed him all the while without ſpeaking one word to him, taking him for the gouty old man, whom they would not waken. When they were in the Caſtle, they did carry him up into a Chamber, without looking on him, deſiring with all ſpeed to impart unto their Maſter that they had fullfilled his Commandment, for fear they ſhould be checked for their delay.</p>
            <p>The Governour having ſpoken to them, did take the pains to come to ſee him with one of his Gentlemen, and becauſe he never ſaw the gouty old Man, and never heard whether he were old or young, he miſtook
<hi>Francion</hi> for him. Taking him then by the arm, and ſhaking him very ſtrongly, he ſaid unto him, There is but little reſpect in you, Sir, and leſſe honeſty; Why doe you not riſe to doe your reverence to thoſe who are in authority over you. <hi>Francion</hi> being not able to ſtand on his Leggs, did ſalute him no otherwiſe, but with a nod only of his head. The Governour ſaid unto him, How! Doth your Gout hold you ſo obſtinately? I ſhall quickly rid you of it, I warrant you. I have not only the Gout, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> but Rivers of afflictions, I am afraid you will not ſo quickly make them to glide away, ſay what you will, for the ſprings from whence they are derived will be never dry. The Governour interrupted him, and ſaid, For bear that diſcourſe, I ſent not for thee to paſſe away the time in ſuch unprofitable complaints. Tell me, Art not thou a perfidious, and a wicked diſturber of the publick peace? The people have lived in much quiet under my protection, which was ſo agreeable to them, that they could not complain of any of my actions, but thou, who deſireſt to ſet the whole City on a flame to ſatisfie thy inordinate deſire, haſt raiſed a dangerous tumult. What willt thou allege for thy own defence? willt thou yet affirm that thou hadſt not a deſign to trouble the repoſe of the Inhabitants, to cauſe me to be either killed or driven away from this place? Come hither, and declare unto me who it was that did induce thee to it. Haſt thou found any ill carriage du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of my Government? Is it for any particular offence which I have done thee? I doe not remember that I ever gave thee any cauſe to be offended at me. <hi>Francion</hi> hearing all this diſcourſe, and being not able to apprehend the reaſon of it, did at the laſt imagin that they did but make ſport with him, for the Governour ſpoke not with the countenance of an angry man. His mind was not ſo ſick as his body, and the good adventure which he did meet with that night, did render him very joyfull, he therefore determined with himſelf to make as good paſtime with the Governour, as the Governour did with him. To anſwer to all your points, ſaid he, I tell you, that I would have ſet all this City in a Tumult, becauſe nothing is more agreeable to me than to ſee it in ſuch on eſtate. The He Neighbour now enters into the houſe of his Female Neighbour, and ſhe goes into the houſe of her next Neighbour; Lovers enter into thoſe places, the doors whereof they before durſt not look upon. In this confuſion, thoſe who are gallant ſpirits have the opportunity to play bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and at all adventure. Do not believe that I do bear unto you any hatred at all, I never knew what hatred was, although, not to diſſemble, I have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject enough to be angry with you, becauſe you doe not here eſtabliſh one Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance which is neceſſary: What Ordinance is that? ſaid the Governour; The beſt and the moſt juſt one in the world, replyed <hi>Francion,</hi> It is for the time to come, that Women ſhould once a year goe ſtark naked quite through the City, that ſo the Inhabitants may feed their eyes with the ſight of a deſirable object, for what reaſon have they to cover and hide themſelves with ſo much care? Is there not as great an abſurdity in it, as poſſible can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined? They doe ſhow themſelves naked in particular to every one, one after another, And what danger can there be, ſo to ſhew themſelves, when we <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59287:130"/>ſhall be all together? I aſſure my ſelf that you will allege unto me that we all looking on them, we ſhall better mark thoſe imperfections which they have, for two eyes ſee more than one, and this will be to their prejudice. But it may be you have a deſire to affirm, that we ought not to look upon their naked bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but only one by one, that ſo we may all think we are the particular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyers of that happineſſe.

               </gap> enough, for it is well known what it is that we ſo much doe deſire to ſee in Women, and the fine inventions of graver men, are to no effect. For the Women, you ought not to take their part ſo much, as any ways to procure the diſadvantage of Men, who have more reſemblance unto you. The Governour knew not whether he had beſt to laugh, or to be angry at this delicate Oration, and made ſo much to the purpoſe, in relation to that which he had ſpoken. Nevertheleſſe he did ſpeak to
<hi>Francion</hi> in this manner, Obſerve what I ſay, and doe not think to eſcape by playing the Fool, for I will ſpeedily cauſe you to be apprehended, I ſpeak in good earneſt to you.</p>
            <p>On thoſe words there entred ſome of the Counſellors of the City, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the Governour if he had ſent for the Gouty Delinquent. He made anſwer to them, See where he is, but I conceive him to be either a Fool, or a Counterfeit, I cannot get an anſwer from him that hath any reaſon in it. One of the company demanded of him, Who is he that brought that Man unto you? Do you take him for that Gouty perſon whom we come to demand? he is as much that Man, as I am the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Governour ſaid, that he was then abuſed, and that he was brought unto him for that Man. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he called thoſe men to him who did conduct him thither, and demanded of them wherefore they had deceived him, for he was not the ſame perſon of whom he had ſpoken to them. They turning their eyes towards him, did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him, that they did not bring that Man to him, but another, who was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lame, and antient. The Devil then, ſaid the Governour, hath carryed him away, and put this Fellow in his place. Every one did exerciſe his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the miſtake, and told him all with one voice, that he alone could ſatisfie him from whence the error did proceed. What need you to be ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed? ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> He who was ſet in the chair is fled away, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire which I had to reſt my ſelf, did make me to take his place.</p>
            <p>The Porters were then checked for their negligence, and they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to goe forth again to look out the old Incendiary, who not long after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was apprehended, and put into the hands of Juſtice, and condemned to be hanged, which accordingly was put in execution; and from that day he was cured of his Gout, and all his other maladies.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Francion,</hi> they did let him goe whither he pleaſed, without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance. He conſidered with himſelf a long time, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> it were his beſt courſe to return to the Village, or not, and at the laſt he reſolved not to go thither any more, and all his thoughts reflecting upon <hi>Nays,</hi> he did not regard to perform that which he had promiſed to <hi>Iocunda,</hi> becauſe the enjoyment of her had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away that little paſſion which he had for her. By this means that Maid was juſtly puniſhed for abandoning her ſelf to a Man, of whom ſhe had no more knowledge, and who did goe away from her, without bidding her Farewell, or taking the leaſt care for her. She ought for the time to come, to be circumſpect how ſhe contracted ſuch uncertain loves. As for <hi>Francion,</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find that any misfortune did befall him, out of which he was not releaſed, for although he committed ſome faults, yet he never deſiſted to have an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto vertue, and God will not loſe or deſtroy thoſe, who one day will become vertuous.</p>
            <p>Having no more affection to the pleaſures of the Country,
<hi>Francion</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to repair to <hi>Lyons,</hi> to borrow ſome moneys there, to put himſelf into an <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59287:130"/>equipage to follow his former adventures. The firſt man whom in the way he did meet with, was a Souldier very empty of mony; he was cloathed with an old pair of Red breeches, and with a leather doublet, which was very grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. He demanded of him, If he would change cloaths with him? and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him ſome money over and above in advantage. The Souldier agreed with him, and for a little money he did renounce his Nobility, to take upon him the habit of a Peaſant.
<hi>Francion</hi> began to admire himſelf in this goodly attire, which did pleaſe him more than any other; and having bought the Sword alſo of this gallant Warrier, he was much troubled how to wear it, becauſe the Souldier would not ſell his Belt; for, he ſaid, he would reſerve that, to ſerve him always as a Witneſſe that he came from the Wars; there being abroad in the world many ſuch Companions, who having ſold their Muskets, do content themſelves to carry their <hi>Reſts</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion</hi> at the laſt remembring that he had about him a great leather thong with which he did tye and lead his dogg, when heretofore he performed the Office of a Shepherd, did think good to make uſe of it, and did carry his ſword in that, as in a ſcarf. He had a Hat with a narrow brim, and picked at the top, made after an antick faſhion, which pleaſed him very highly. His journy was long, he therefore travelled ſometimes on horſeback, and ſometimes on foot, according to the occaſions which he found, but his diligence made all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch that poſſibly it could, and he expended not any mony, but with great wiſdom and moderation. I will not tell you whether in his way he travelled over Rivers, or over Mountains, or paſſed through Cities or Towns, I am not in the humor to buſy my ſelf with thoſe particulars. You may obſerve that I have not repreſented to you in what place <hi>Nays</hi> was at the <hi>Waters,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were at
<hi>Pougues,</hi> or any other place; neither have I given you the Name of the Fortreſſe where <hi>Francion</hi> was a Priſoner, nor of the Village where he was a Shepherd, or of the City where <hi>Iocunda</hi> lived. It is a ſign I have no deſire you ſhould know it; becauſe I do not name it to you. Let us content our ſelves that <hi>Francion,</hi> after the travel of certain days, did lodge at a Village not far from <hi>Lyons,</hi> and the next day being Sunday, he came early in the morning to a Town more near unto it. Every one was then at Church to hear Maſſe ſaid. Finding none at the Inne to give him wherewith to refreſh himſelf, he determined with himſelf to ſit under the great Elm in the Churchyard, which did grant him a favourable ſhade, and to ſtay there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they did come out of the Church. One of the Town having ſome buſineſſe to perform more than the reſt, or being more haſty to eat his Dinner, did firſt of all come forth, and paſſing by <hi>Francion,</hi> did take him for one of thoſe Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, who after the Wars are ended do go up and down the Villages to ſell Druggs, and ſhew juggling tricks by the virtue of <hi>Hocus Pocus.</hi> You Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter, ſaid he, What have you to ſell there? The moſt excellent druggs in the World, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> who immediatly apprehended what he was taken to be; they cure all manner of Diſeaſes: I make knowing thoſe who are ignorant, I make rich, in a ſhort time, the pooreſt men in the World. Where have you put them, ſaid the Peaſant, I ſee neither Cloak-bagg nor Portmantua? Thou art a Clown, replyed <hi>Francion,</hi> Thinkeſt thou that my Merchandiſe is like to that of other men? No, no, It is not made of the ſame Ingredients, It hath nothing viſible in it, I do carry it in my head Pronouncing theſe words in a grave and ſerious manner, the Peaſant believed that he did ſpeak the truth, and forgetting all his other Imployments, he would have the honour in the firſt place to acquaint all thoſe of the Town with the News of this ſo rare Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank, who did know, and could do all things. Every one of them had the Curioſity to ſee him, and the Maſs was no ſooner ended, but he was incompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed round about with perſons of all ages.</p>
            <p>Being obliged to act the Mountebank, when he ſaw himſelf invironed with <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59287:131"/>ſuch a multitude, he reſolved to make a pleaſant uſe of the opportunity which was offered, and putting himſelf into a good humor, he began to utter a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand merry conceits to entertain them with. When he obſerved that his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors did give him a favourable attention to underſtand whither his Diſcourſe would tend, he made this Oration to them.</p>
            <p>My good People, Take notice that I am none of thoſe Impoſtors who run up and down the Country, and ſell you Oyls and Balſoms that will take away all Evils, and nevertheleſſe help not one. I will furniſh you with divers. I am more full of knowledge than the illuſtrious
<hi>Tabarin,</hi> whom who is there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt who hath not ſeen in theſe flouriſhing Cities of <hi>France?</hi> I call my ſelf a Phyſician, and am rather a Profeſſor, than a maker of Medicins; According to the Diſeaſes which I find, I do either preſcribe Phyſick, or I do make it my ſelf. Moreover, (my dear friends) There is another kind of Merchandiſe which I do bear in my brain, I have ſo much Underſtanding and Spirit, that I can ſell ſome of it to others. I diſtribute to all men apprehenſion, ſubtilty, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Mark me well, he that looks upon me, let him know, that I am deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of a Race, where all the male Children are conſtantly Prophets; So were my Father, &amp; my Grandfather: but alas they underſtood nothing at all in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of me, I have my own knowledge by Nature, beſides that which they have taught me. If I would my ſelf, I ſhould alwayes be at the elbows of Kings, but I preferr liberty above riches; It is more meritorious for me, and I ſerve God better by going from Town to Town charitably to aſſiſt all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Perſons, than to continue ſtill in one Court or City. I will not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my ſelf to relate ſome odde Story to you, according to the antient Cuſtom, to ſtir up your Attention by Laughter, It becometh not a man of my Learning to be ſo great a Buffian. Let thoſe who have need of my Counſel in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs repair unto me one by one, to my own Lodging. I can inform young Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers if their Miſtreſſes be Maids, or not, I can inform Husbands if their Wives have made them Cuckolds, or not. For the ordinary Diſeaſes of your Bodies, I will diſcourſe further of them too morrow, when I ſhall come upon this place again.</p>
            <p>As he ſpoke thoſe words, the Peaſants did ſo throng about him, that a Lev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret could not paſſe between their leggs. They leer'd upon him with glances of higheſt approbation, and made geſtures of admiration, liſtning moſt atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to what he ſaid; and becauſe they did believe him, they did not dare to enquire any thing of him. Every one imagined that if he ſhould make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before others that he ſuſpected his Wife had made him a Cuckold, they would undoubtedly believe that he was one, and would ever afterwards laugh at him. Thoſe who deſired to be ſatisfied in that particular, did determine with themſelves to ask him in privat ſome other time concerning it, and the Lovers were of the ſame adviſe to underſtand the chaſtity of their Miſtreſſes: But to make trial of the knowledge of the Mountebank in other particulars, divers queſtions were openly propounded to him. Maſter (ſaid a Waggo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) Tell me ſome Invention, by the practiſe of which I never may want mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Travel perpetually, (replyed <hi>Francion</hi>) for thoſe who will pay thee well. Lend nothing to thoſe who have not a deſire to reſtore it, and every day in a hole which thou ſhalt make in the ground, bury one <hi>Sous,</hi> and thou ſhalt find there at the end of the year Three hundred ſixty and five; But the Waggoner (who had an acute deſire to ſhew himſelf to be as witty and frolick as the Mountebank) ſaid unto him, Maſter, Since a few ſeeds of Corn ſown in my ground, do bring me ſo many ears full laden, will you adviſe me to ſow as many Crowns? If I ſhould ſow them, tell me, I pray. What would they produce? They would produce Thieves (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) who would come to digg them up.</p>
            <p>There was at the ſame time a Peaſant who ſaid unto him, I have been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59287:131"/>married to a young Woman who doth nothing elſe but follow me, I would fain know for what it is? It is becauſe thou goeſt before, ſaid <hi>Francion.</hi> To all ſuch fooliſh demands, he ſuddenly returned the like anſwers, which made the Peaſants laugh; for ſuch entertainment was proper for ſuch perſons. But Hunger prevailing on him, he deſired the Company to give him leave to go to Dinner, and adviſed them to come afterwards to the Tavern, where he would endeavour to ſatisfie them all concerning that which they deſired of him.</p>
            <p>The Taverner, who was preſent, did conduct him to his Houſe, and leaving the Company of his Wife, did come to take his repaſt with him. When they were both together, and no other with them, he ſaid unto him, I have a Wife which is fair enough, as you your ſelf behold, I have had alwayes in my mind an Imagination that ſhe hath made me a Cuckold, Deliver me, I beſeech you, from this unquietneſſe of Spirit. I will, ſaid
<hi>Francion,</hi> you appear to me to be a brave man, and it is moſt fit that you ſhould know how the affair doth ſtand in that particular; This Evening, going to Bed, tell her you have underſtood from me, that before too morrow morning all Cuckolds ſhould be turned into Doggs; Obſerve what ſhe doth ſay, and moreover what ſhe doth thereupon, and you and I will adviſe together of the reſt.</p>
            <p>The Taverner did content himſelf with this Counſel, and did ſpeak no more unto him, when immediatly there entred into the room a Company of Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, to be reſolved of <hi>Francion</hi> in ſome doubfull points concerning their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. There were young Men who came unto him to demand if their Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes had their Maidenheads. He enquired after their Names, and the Names of the Maids, and having made a little pauſe thereupon, he told to ſome that their Miſtreſſes had loſt their Maidenheads, and to others, that they had ſtill preſerved the flower of their Virginity, accordingly as it came to his Fancy. As ſoon as they were gone, there entred a good old Farmer, who did take him aſide, and ſaid unto him, Sir, I am very much perplexed, My Daughter hath acquainted her Mother that ſhe is great with child, and ſhe doth not know by whom; If we knew who it were, we would cauſe him to marry her if he were a rich man; and if he were not, we would cauſe him to be puniſhed: My Wife and I were for a certain time abroad in a Pilgrimage, In the mean time, ſhe did ly alone in our Chamber, and ſhe cannot tell who it was that came to raviſh her Maidenhead from her, He that did force it from her would not ſpeak a word. <hi>Francion</hi> made anſwer, It is very likely it was one of your Servants; I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſo too, ſaid the Peaſant, but there are ſix of them, two Ploughmen, two Tilemakers, a Shepherd, and a Swineherd, to whom of theſe ſhall I addreſſe my ſelf? tell me Sir, I beſeech you, what I ſhall do in this Caſe. <hi>Francion</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto him, Do you and your Wife lie this Night out of your Lodging, and let your Daughter ſleep in the ſame Bed in which ſhe loſt her Maidenhead, and let the door be no more locked than it was at that time. He who already hath been familiar with her, will come again to viſit her without doubt; and if he will not yet ſpeak, ſhe ſhall mark him on the forhead with a certain mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which I ſhall give her: the mark will not ſo ſuddenly go out, but the next morning you may diſcover it very plainly, and by this means you may diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver who it was.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Francion</hi> had ſpoke thoſe words, he entreated the Peaſant to leave him for a little time, that he might prepare his drug. He took Lamb-black, which he mingled with Oyl, and afterwards brought to him, ſaying, that his Daughter with that ought to mark the forhead of the man who came to lie with her. The Peaſant returned home, and communicated the affair to his Wife, who did agree to all that which he deſired. After that, he departed with his Wife from his own houſe, and repaired to a Friends houſe in the Neighbouring Village, where he reſolved to ſup, and to lodge there that <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59287:132"/>night. Night being come, his Daughter did goe to Bed in her own Chamber, and did not make faſt the door with the bolt. Her Fathers ſix ſervants were in the Chamber directly over againſt it. They were all aſleep but the Shepherd, the Chamber directly over againſt it. They were all aſleep but the Shepherd, who was he that had before been too familiar with her; He was inamoured on her, and ſeeing an occaſion as inviting and propitious as ever to lye with her, he determined with himſelf to go unto her, and riſing from his own bed, he ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened the door, and came to the Bed of his Miſtreſſe.</p>
            <p>The expectation and deſign which ſhe had, did hinder her from ſleep, ſo that hearing him to approach, ſhe prepared her ſelf to perform that which ſhe was commanded; As he indeavoured to kiſſe her and imbrace her, ſhe did thruſt him back with one hand, and with one of the fingers of her other hand, which ſhe had dipped in the oyl, ſhe touched his Forehead, and afterwards was not ſo carefull to defend her ſelf, thinking that ſhe had done enough. In the firſt reſpite after their imbraces, having her judgement more free than in the time of pleaſure, ſhe deſired him to confeſſe unto her who he was, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him that he could get nothing by concealing himſelf, for the Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banck who is now in the Town, and knows every thing that is done, would on the next morning diſcover him unto her. She ſaid unto him, wherefore doe you not ſpeak unto me? How would you have me to love you, when I cannot know who you are? He then confeſſed to her that he was the Shepherd, and did repreſent unto her how entirely he did love her. O Lord, ſaid ſhe, I would you had ſpoken to me a little ſooner, I would not have marked you as I now have done, you have a mark on your Forehead which will not ſuddenly be wiped away, and too morrow my Father will know by it, that you have lain with me, you know that he doth not love you, and will never give way that we ſhall be marryed together, he will cauſe you to be puniſhed by Juſtice for which I ſhall be extremely ſorry, for I always loved you above any other, although I never did expreſſe as much unto you. I thank you for your good will, ſaid the Shepherd, and I muſt beſeech you to continue it; But give me that drug I pray, with which you have rubbed my Forehead, and I will ſo order it, that your Father ſhall not know who it was that lay with you. The Girl thereupon did put into his hand a little pot, where the Black wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and he anointed one of his Fingers with it, and going into the Chamber of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who were all aſleep, he marked the Forehead of every one of them. Having done that, he came again to bed to his Miſtreſſe, with whom he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed away that Night.</p>
            <p>The day no ſooner appeared, but the Maſter of the lodging arrived, who deſiring to know if he could diſcover him who had lain with his Daughter, be cauſed all his Servants to come before him, and having looked upon them all, he was amazed to ſee all their Foreheads marked with black, whereupon in a great choler he did goe unto his Daughter, and ſaid unto her, If all thoſe who have their Foreheads coloured with Black have lain with thee this Night, there was never the Daughter of a Husbandman that hath been more ſoundly occupied than thy ſelf. She did proteſt unto him, that there came but one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, againſt whom ſhe could have well defended her ſelf, but then ſhe could never have diſcovered him, and ſhe knew not how the reſt came to be ſo mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. All the remedy which the honeſt Peaſant had, was to have recourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain unto the Mountebanck, and to acquaint him with that which had arrived, and to know of him in this Caſe what Expedient he had to uſe. <hi>Francion</hi> having a little while conſulted on it, did ſay unto him, Return home with all the ſpeed you can, and cauſe all your Servants again to come before him, and obſerve if without doubt who hath lain with your Daughter. He made all the haſt he could to his own houſe, and having looked on all their-hands, he found that there was not any one of them that had a black finger but the Shepherd only.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59287:132"/>Ha, ſaid he, It is thou then who haſt diſhonoured my houſe, I will cauſe thee to be apprehended, and, being condemned by juſtice, to be hanged. What a moſt impudent knave art thou, when ſhe was aſleep, to violate the Daughter of thy Maſter. Speaking thoſe words, he did take the Shepherd by the Collar, and commanded that the reſt of his Servants ſhould lay hold on him to carry him to priſon, but the Shepherd ſaid unto him, Ah good Maſter, It is true that I have lain with your Daughter, I cannot deny it, It is as true alſo that the firſt time that I did come unto her, ſhe was aſleep, but immediatly after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhe did awake, and permitted me quietly to accompliſh what I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to doe, ſo that you cannot affirm that I did force her, for thoſe of her age, and of ſuch a patience too, cannot properly be ſaid to be raviſhed.</p>
            <p>As he did ſpeak this, The Mother, the Uncle, and the Aunt of the Daughter arrived, who being advertiſed of the fact, did perſwade the furious Father to be pacified, repreſenting to him that Marriages were made in heaven before they were celebrated upon Earth, and that without doubt Heaven had ordained that this Shepherd ſhould marry his Daughter; they declared that be was a thriving young Man, and that of neceſſity he muſt marry them together to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe the fault, if it were any fault at all. The buſineſſe was ſo well diſputed, that on the very ſame day the accord was made, to the great contentment of both parties, and the Father declaring the admirable inventions which the Mountebanck had taught him, to diſcover him who had defloured his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, did determine with himſelf to give him many thanks, and a round re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>While theſe things did ſo happily fall out, the knowledge and the Fortune of <hi>Francion</hi> had yet another effect. His Hoſt, who would prove the chaſtity of his Wife, did ſeek after that which he deſired not to know, and going to Bed, he failed not to put his counſell into practice. He ſaid unto his Wife, Sweet-heart, you do not know what ſtrange news I have heard. Why! what is it, ſaid ſhe, Is it not poſſible for me to be partaker of it? No, No, replyed he, you are too great a Pratler. Upon my Faith, ſaid ſhe, I will not ſpeak a word, will you not tell me? will you not? well I ſee now you do not love me, you know I can conceal any Secret. Say you ſo? replyed he, and that is very ſtrange. Well! I will tell you, but be you aſſured that you ſpeak not of it. The Mountebanck hath aſſured me, that all the Cuckolds in the Town ſhall before Day break be metamorphoſed into Dogs. Is that all? ſaid ſhe, why what need you care, you are not one. The Hoſt muttered to her between his Teeth, I know it well enough, nevertheleſſe we ought to have a fellow fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with thoſe who are our Neighbours. His Wife purſuing the diſcourſe, did ſay unto him, Howſoever it be, we ought not to believe ſuch an ungifted Prophet as he is; He never doth foretell Holydays unto us, but when they are already come; do not you ſleep the worſe for him; for my ſelf, I cannot yet have the leiſure to go to Bed ſo ſoon, I muſt go down and heat the Oven, your Servant being but newly come knows not well how to do it. She did ſpeak theſe words to take an occaſion to go out of doors, and inſtead of going to heat the Oven, ſhe did goe to the Churchyard, where all her female Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours were aſſembled: It was impoſſible for her to hold her Tongue, ſhe therefore diſcovered to them what her Husband had imparted to her. They were all amazed at the tydings, and immediatly every one of them made haſt to declare it to all thoſe Women who were of their acquaintance, ſo that in a Moment the whole Town was full of the news.</p>
            <p>The Taverners wife going afterwards to Bed to her Husband, did with much impatience attend the break of day, to perceive what would arrive unto him; As ſoon as it was light, ſhe did riſe, and taking the Coverlet from his Face, ſhe obſerved if he had his accuſtomed ſhape. When ſhe beheld that he was ſtill a Man, ſhe let him alone, being unwilling to wake him, and did make her <pb n="17" facs="tcp:59287:133"/>ſelf ready to go down to follow her Imployment. But preſently afterwards her Husband awaking, and remembring the counſel which on the night before the Mountebank had given him, he reſolved with himſelf to make tryal of it, and did counterfeit the voice of a Dogg. His Wife, who (to ſpeak the truth) did at that time moſt entirely love him, hearing him to bark like a Maſtiff, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affrighted to hear that noiſe, did fall down at the feet of the Bed, and with her hands liſted up, did begin to cry out, Oh good God! For two poor faults only muſt my poor Husband be turned into a Dogge? He immediately did ariſe, and (although the manner of her Complaint was enough to ſoften any heart) he did beat her ſoundly, ſaying to her, No, No, It is not I who ſhall be turn'd into a Dogg, God doth not puniſh Husbands for the offences of their Wives, It is you who ſhall be transformed into a Bitch, or a She-wolf, or into any other Beaſt, if there be any more ravenous and ſenſual than that. Have you twice indeed made a forfeit of your Honor? Tell me how, in what place, and with whom? Dear Husband, ſaid ſhe, If you will promiſe to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, I will conceal nothing from you. Yes, replyed he, I do pardon thee; but tell me all, and have a care that you commit not the ſame fault any more, She ſaid unto him, About eight days after we were married, you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that there was a young Lord who llved in this Village, who was a brave Companion, and did come to court me; he declared to me that Women of the City were not ſo ſtupid as thoſe in the Country, and that they refuſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which was demanded of them, and that I being young and handſom ought to do the ſame, to gain favour and eſtimation amongſt Gentlemen of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion. He thereupon did come to kiſſe me, and did proceed further, without any reſiſtance; for I had a deſire to repreſent unto him, that I had profited by his Inſtructions, and I believed it was a diſcourteous part to deny him any thing. So with him I paſſed the firſt paſſe; but not long afterwards the Groom of his Chamber having incountred me in a Dark Entry, when he would have made much of me, I ſhewed not my ſelf ſo eaſie to him. He thought that it was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity which made a Thief, and that being both where none could ſee us, I would permit my ſelf to be abuſed by him; but I knew well enough how to ſay unto him, Go, get you gone, you are not your Maſter, Do you think that any one will give that liberty unto you, as unto him? Since I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſufficiently, that I ſhould give no admiſſion at all, either unto Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or to Man, and my Innocence was the Companion of my Youth. Nevertheleſſe there being Souldiers here one day who ranſacked the houſe when you were in the City, there was one of them who ſaid unto me, Of two things I muſt needs have one, I muſt either take away all your Hens, or lie with you. I had rather that he ſhould lie with me, becauſe I would not incurr your diſpleaſure; for if he had taken away the Poultry, you would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, but you could never perceive if he did lie with me or not: for in that Theft nothing is taken away, nor is there any thing put out of its place. You ſee here (my Husband) how I have failed twice, but in my own judgement, it is not worthy of your puniſhment. It is a common ſaying, that the firſt fault deſerveth admonition, and the ſecond ought to be pardoned; and that the third only, and thoſe which follow afterwards, are to pay for all. You do well to pardon, becauſe I have not offended thrice. In good time (ſaid her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band) but Miſtreſſe, I would have you know, that twice is enough to make a Man a Cuckold; he indeed who hath on his forehead but one point of the Horn, cannot properly be ſaid to be Cornuted; for he muſt have there both ends thereof who is a Cuckold of the right ſtamp. But Husband (ſaid the Wife) you muſt underſtand, that he is no Cuckold, who doth not think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be one; and ſince I was ſo ſimple when I offended againſt the Laws of Marriage, that I did not conceive to make you a Cuckold, you are not one in effect. There is another thing of which I have heard wiſe men to ſpeak, When <pb n="18" facs="tcp:59287:133"/>a Woman hath a deſire to make her Husband a Cuckold, although it ſhould never come to effect, yet is he ſtill to be ranked amongſt the number of Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kolds; but on the contrary, if ſhe ſhould loſe that deſire, and love none but only her Husband, he is no longer to be reputed to be one; Otherwiſe, Why ſhould that blemiſh ſtill continue, when the Occaſions, and all Inducements thereunto, are happily vaniſhed? Shall an old Man be ſtill a Cuckold when his Wife is full of age, and witherd as himſelf? Her Husband did approve her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and for the time to come did reſolve with himſelf to live in peace and love with ſo wiſe a Woman.</p>
            <p>The other Women, who by the common report had been advertiſed that all Cuckolds ſhould be metamorphoſed into Doggs, did much perplex themſelves about it, eſpecially thoſe who had too careleſly forfeited their honour. They could not ſleep all that night, &amp; ceaſed not to feel if the hair were come all over their Husbands,

               </gap> if their ears were not longer, and more pendent than before; There were ſome who were not ſo ſecret, but acquainted their Husbands with what they heard; who obſerving that they fear'd they ſhould be metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, did from thence conjecture, that their Wives were not ſo chaſt as they ought to have been, &amp; did beat them ſo ſoundly, that they had not afterwards a deſire to be circumvented by the fair Language of their Wanton Lovers; Nevertheleſs, they knew not what wel to believe concerning the prophecy of the Mountebank; for they all took him to be a Man of great knowledge &amp; experience, and it being Holyday, every one with impatience attended the hour to ſee him come upon the place.
<hi>Fran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               </hi> to content himſelf, had imployed all that night in making Unguents with Butter and Bees-wax, and Oyl, and the juyce of ſome herbs, with other Ingredients, and reſolved with himſelf to diſtribute them, and to take good mony for them, of which at that time he was in great Neceſſity. He had learned how to compoſe Druggs by the books which he had read on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for curioſity; and to ſpeak the truth, his Medicaments did conduce rather unto Good than to Evil; for he would not perſcribe any thing, but with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation and judgement. It was quite croſſe to his deſires, that this frolick adventure of his ſhould procure damage unto any one, but he endeavoured ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to render himſelf profitable to all, as in effect whatſoever we have ſeen him do in this Village, did afford more pleaſure than prejudice.</p>
            <p>The Hour being come in which he was to appear in publick, he cauſed all his Merchandiſe to be carried in a great box on the place by a little boy. He would have been glad to have been acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modated with a Gittern to delight his ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, &amp; to counterfeit a Mountebank in the beſt manner that he could; but there being not a Gittern in the Town, he entertained them with a Diſcourſe which pleaſed them better than Muſick. He made no mention at all of the Cuckolds that ſhould have been transformed into Doggs; for the Women who were jealous of the event, and

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound the error of it, did now laugh that report into ſcorn. The Oration which he made to commend the excellence of his Druggs was hardly begun, but behold there came into that place a Man on Horſeback, who having liſtned to him a little time, and well obſerved him, did alight, and cleaving through the Preſſe he did approach unto him, and kiſſing his Thigh, he ſaid unto him, Ah my good Maſter! In what an equipage are you here? How glad am I that I have found you again?
<hi>Francion</hi> knew well enough, when ever he diſcerned him, that it was the Groom of his Chamber, but he was not yet pleaſed to ſpeak unto him; and having ſaluted him with a little Ceremony, he only ſaid unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Withdraw your ſelf, We by and by will diſcourſe together. Give me leave a little to content theſe honeſt people. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly he did fall again on the Commendation of his Druggs, and to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute them to thoſe who did deſire them. Some of them he ſold for one <hi>Sous,</hi> and ſome for two. He took as much as was needfull for every Drugg, which with a knife he did put upon a Paper; and to make it apparent to them that <pb n="19" facs="tcp:59287:134"/>his Druggs were good, he took ſome part thereof upon the point of a knife, and giving it to his Boy, he would ſay unto him, Go too, Sirrah, you are a good Boy, you ſhall have this licouriſh bit, and this, and this, and this; Nay, and this alſo. That which is moſt excellent is in the bottom of all the Budge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, the beſt is alwayes there, when you are a married Man, ask your Wife if it be not ſo. He had many other terms which the Mountebanks do uſe to allure and circumvent their Merchants, and the complacence of his geſture did adde much grace to his Diſcourſe inſomuch that <hi>Petronius,</hi> who was the Groom of his Chamber, was never more aſtoniſhed; and having conſidered with himſelf the Repulſe he gave him, could not well be perſwaded that it was his Maſters voice: But at laſt, all the Confections being ſold, he abandoned the Company, and entertained <hi>Petronius</hi> with the teſtimonies of an Incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Joy. The Aſſembly of the Peaſants being diſperſed, they repaired to their Inne to repoſe themſelves. <hi>Francion</hi> demanded of
<hi>Petronius</hi> in the firſt place, where were all his Servants? He made anſwer, that after the loſſe of their Maſter, they were all departed to ſeek their fortunes, believing that he had been dead, and as for himſelf he ceaſed not to ſeek after him, as well in <hi>France,</hi> as in
<hi>Italy,</hi> and if he had not now met with him, he would have gon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to
<hi>Rome</hi> to ſee if he could there find him out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion</hi> did briefly declare unto him all his adventures, which did wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſtoniſh him, and aſſuring him that he languiſhed with a deſire to be at <hi>Rome</hi> to ſee again his
<hi>Nays,</hi> he reſolved preſently to take horſe for <hi>Lyons,</hi> to ſupply himſelf with moneys to ſatisfie the expences of his Journy.
<hi>Petronius</hi> ſaid unto him, That having loſt him, and not knowing what to do with his Horſes and his Baggage, he had ſold all, excepting one Horſe, and that he had ſtill about him the greateſt part of the money.
<hi>Francion</hi> was very glad to hear that, and having received the moneys of him, he bought a little Nagg for <hi>Petronius</hi> in the ſame Village, and mounted himſelf on the other, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately departed, leaving all the Townſmen very highly ſatisfied. It was late before they could arrive at
<hi>Lyons,</hi> ſo that <hi>Francion</hi> was not ſeen with that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly habit on his back.</p>
            <p>The next morning very early he did ſend for a Taylor, who did apparel him Cap-a-pea, he addreſſed himſelf alſo to a Money-merchant of his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who promiſed to lend him as much money as he deſired, knowing well enough, that he ſhould loſe nothing by him. He demanded of him Letters of Change to receive money at <hi>Rome,</hi> and gave him others to ſend unto his Mother for the re-disburſement of the money which he was to borrow. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus put his affairs in order, he travelled the direct way towards <hi>Italy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attended by <hi>Petronius</hi> only, to whom he promiſed great Rewards for his Fidelity. He made ſuch a Diſpatch, that he minded not to take notice of what rare things were to be ſeen in the Towns which he paſſed thorough. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee nothing but <hi>Nays,</hi> whoſe ſight he preferred above all that which is eſteemed moſt precious in this world.</p>
            <p>There fell not throughout the whole Courſe of his travels, any thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be recorded; For he had not the leiſure to regard the Towns as he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, nor to ſport himſelf with thoſe Men whom he did meet with in the way. It may be ſufficient to underſtand, that after the Journeys of many dayes he arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> and took up his Lodgings in that place where the <hi>French</hi> have ordinarily their Reſidence; and ſix dayes were not fully paſſed, before he was advertiſed of the arrival of <hi>Raymond</hi> and <hi>Dorini.</hi> He immediatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to ſalute them, and it may be well affirmed, that never in any Interview of Friends there was manifeſted ſo much true Joy, as at the meeting of theſe; When <hi>Francion</hi> declared to them his adventures of a Shepherd, and of being a Mountebank, he did raviſh them all with admiration. O Lord! (ſaid <hi>Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi>) How ſorry am I that we came no ſooner into
<hi>Italy?</hi> We might poſſibly <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59287:134"/>have received the news of your diſaſter, and we would not have left you in ſuch a bad condition. You deceive your ſelf, ſaid <hi>Francion.</hi> I ſhould be ſorry replyed <hi>Raymond,</hi> to have taken <hi>Francion</hi> from that eſtate of life wherein he was; He would not then have performed ſuch gallant things; They are ſo rare, that I aſſure my ſelf he would always moſt freely renounce the greateſt dignities to atchieve the like; you would have done him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> injury as but in the imagination to have thought to have relieved him. You have reaſon ſo to ſay, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> and truly I would not have lived otherwiſe than I have done, Nevertheleſſe, I will aſſure you, that even this courſe of life is at the beſt but a meerfolly and trifling vexation. It is true, ſaid <hi>Raymond,</hi> but theſe follies are oftentimes of more worth than the moſt ſerious imployments of thoſe who govern Nations. If they ſhould fall into the ſame diſaſters as you have done, they would have enough to do to endure them with the ſame conſtancy of Spirit, to rejoyce &amp; make ſport at the calamities which Fortune had prepared for you.</p>
            <p>Let us abandon this diſcourſe, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> It is not to me to whom ſuch praiſe doth belong. We are now in a Country where there is nothing of true merit but <hi>Nays</hi> only; Tell me <hi>Dorini,</hi> Have you received no intelligence of her? She is undouhtedly in this City, ſaid <hi>Dorini,</hi> I will by and by addreſſe my ſelf unto her, for the love which I bear to you. <hi>Dorini</hi>'s deed did jump, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take his words, and immediatly he departed to give a viſitation to his Kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had a houſe in <hi>Rome</hi> in which ſhe was more often than in her Mannors in the Country. After their firſt Complements, he did ſpeak unto her of <hi>Florian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and demanded of her, if ſhe had not received the news of his death? She made anſwer, Yes, and he purſuing, his diſcourſe did ask her, If ſhe had not ſeen him whom he ſent unto her in exchange of him, who was a Gentleman of no leſſe deſert? She made anſwer, that ſhe underſtood very well of whom he did intend to ſpeak, but he was, ſhe ſaid, a moſt inconſtant, and an ingratefull man, ſeeing, having received from her the moſt courteous entertainment in the world, he did forſake her without ſo much as bidding her Farewell, and had ſince ſent her a harſh and an uncivil Letter. <hi>Dorini</hi> deſired to ſee the Letter, and having peruſed it, he aſſured her that it never came from <hi>Francion,</hi> for beſides he was too civil to have written ſuch rude lines, it was not his hand; I have Verſes, ſaid he, in my Pocket which are of his writing, you ſhall be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe your ſelf if the hand be like unto it. But all this is nothing, from whence was it that he wrote this Letter to you? It is only an invention of his Rivals, who are jealous and revengefull; you do believe that he hath forſaken you, when thoſe two wicked men did keep him priſoner. He hath been reduced for your ſake to extreme miſery, and hath been thrown down into the moſt ſordid condition in the world, you ſhall hear the relation of it from his own mouth. He is now in this City with a reſolution to wait upon you, if you will give him permiſſion. <hi>Nays</hi> giving belief to the words of
<hi>Dorini,</hi> and deteſting in her heart the malice of <hi>Ergaſtus</hi> and <hi>Valerius,</hi> did throw the Letter into the fire which they had ſent unto her in the name of <hi>Francion.</hi> She declared to <hi>Dorini</hi> that ſhe ſhould be very glad to ſee him. <hi>Dorini</hi> returned with this well-come news, which did render unto <hi>Francion</hi> an intire contentment: They made haſt to dinner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to give a viſit to her in the afternoon, and did afterwards with <hi>Raymond</hi> go alltogether to wait upon her.
<hi>Raymond,</hi> who before had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen her, did much admire her, and found her to be far more beautifull than in her picture ſhe was repreſented to be, and the others who had ſeen her before, did acknowledge that her perfections increaſed with her years. <hi>Dorini</hi> ſaid unto her, Madam, behold here the braveſt Cavalliers of <hi>France,</hi> who have forſaken their own Countries to pay homage to your beauties. Thereupon <hi>Raymond</hi> and <hi>Francion</hi> did begin their Complements, which the fair Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe did anſwer according to the terms of her ordinary courteſie. <hi>Francion</hi> had a great deſire to take her aſide, to declare unto her the miſeries which <pb n="21" facs="tcp:59287:135"/>love had made him ſuffer for her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his abſence, but he thought it unmannerly to deprive his friends of the ſight of that beautifull Lady. <hi>Dorini</hi> immediatly did recite unto her the Adventures which he paſſed in his Impriſonment, and after wards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Although theſe things were taken for gallantries, and agreeable adventures, yet he forgat not moſt paſſionately to declare himſelf, and to inſiſt moſt of all on the unquietneſſe of his Soul being ſeparated from <hi>Nays,</hi> but his proteſtation was ſo well underſtood, that at this time it paſſed only for an indifferency. After diverſe intertainments theſe brave Cavalliers did take their leave of her, and returned to take their reſts in the houſe where they were lodged.</p>
            <p>On the next morning, as they were at Breakfaſt, it was told them, that two French Gentlemen were at the Gate, who deſired to ſpeak with
<hi>Francion;</hi> He did give order to let them in, and was amazed to ſee young <hi>Buiſſon,</hi> and one named <hi>Audebert,</hi> who was of his own Country; he did courteouſly ſalute them, and having told
<hi>Buiſſon</hi> that he was a Man of his promiſe, he would know of
<hi>Audebert</hi> how they met together; <hi>Audebert</hi> made anſwer to him, that being both at <hi>Lyons,</hi> they did there meet, and ever ſince did not part from one another, and that it was above a Month ſince they came to <hi>Rome.</hi> But there is one thing more, ſaid <hi>Buiſſon,</hi> It ſeems to me that Heaven ordained to cauſe all you beſt friends to come hither to be the witneſſes of all your gallant atchievements.
<hi>Audebert</hi> hath not yet told you, that I have brought along with me a brave man, who boaſteth to have been ſometimes your Schoolmaſter, He is one of the Oracles of theſe times, and doth at every word vomit his Greek and Latine: Who is that? ſaid <hi>Francion;</hi> who? ſaid <hi>Audebert,</hi> Have you not heard of the incomparable <hi>Hortenſius? Hortenſius!</hi> ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> and cryed out, O God, how well might I ſay as
<hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> when in one inſtant he received the news of two Victories, <hi>O Fortune, ſend me but a little ſorrow to qualifie the exceſſe of ſo much happineſſe.</hi> Was it not enough that I muſt underſtand of the coming of <hi>Audebert</hi> whom I have known from my Youth, and of <hi>Buiſſon</hi> whoſe humour doth infinitely pleaſe me, but I muſt be informed that <hi>Hortenſius</hi> is alſo here? That
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> I do mean, who is <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59287:135"/>King of all the brave Spirits in the Vniverſity of <hi>Paris.</hi> O moſt happy Adventure! But my dear Friends, tell me, How comes it about that he is now in
<hi>Rome?</hi> He was not well pleaſed to continue any longer in
<hi>Paris,</hi> ſaid <hi>Audebert.</hi> He believed that his elaborate Vigillations were not well recompenced; ſo that hearing I was determined to goe into <hi>Italy,</hi> he was reſolved to accompany me. But why (ſaid
<hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi>) came not he along with you to ſee me? Doth he think to do here, as when he was in <hi>France?</hi> At <hi>Paris</hi> he would always obſcure himſelf from me; and if by chance he did meet me in the Streets, he would give me but a ſlight ſalutation, without ſpeaking to me at all. He muſt not do ſo here. It is the Cuſtom of the <hi>French</hi> to viſit one another. It is requiſite that we ſhould wait upon him. He hath always (ſaid <hi>Audebert</hi>) been ſomething afraid of you, and I believe it is, becauſe he conceiveth that you are of a lively, and a frolick humor, and do make ſport with him; but I have ſo prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that he hath almoſt loſt that conceit and the reaſon why he came not along with us at this preſent, is, becauſe you know he is very ceremonious, and withall, he is but poorly apparelled; and beſides all this, he muſt ſtudy ſome new Complements to ſalute you, for, having not ſeen you a long time, this firſt Interview muſt needs be remarkable. You do him wrong (replyed
<hi>Francion</hi>) he hath a Spirit prompt enough to ſpeak to me without any preparation. But tell me, By what means gained you the acquaintance of ſo illuſtrious a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage? That indeed deſerves to be accounted to you, (ſaid <hi>Audebert</hi>) and if you have the leiſure to hear it, I will declare it to you. <hi>Francion</hi> having then aſſured him that he was ready to lend an ear to whatſoever he ſhould ſay, (knowing that he would ſpeak nothing that would appear either tedious or diſagreeable) he cauſed him to ſit down, and all thoſe who were preſent did the like.</p>
            <p>As I was at <hi>Paris</hi> (ſaid <hi>Audebert</hi>) to paſs away my time in all ſorts of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, I did ſee almoſt every day two Poets of the Court, one of them was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Saluſt,</hi> and the other
<hi>Eſcluſes,</hi> they were both of them good Companions.
<hi>Saluſt</hi> one day had a deſire to tranſlate into <hi>French</hi> the fourth Eclogue of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil;</hi> but becauſe he did not perfectly underſtand the Latin tongue, and could not perform the work, but only by conferring it with ſome old Tranſlations, he determined with himſelf to communicate it to ſome learned Man. A Printer, one of his friends, did make mention to him of <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> and told him moreover, that he was very skillfull in the Greek and Latin Tongues, and that oftentimes he did write very well in <hi>French,</hi> and had many Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions extant, and did himſelf compoſe very good Verſes. <hi>Salust</hi> had a deſire to ſee him, although he had no acquaintance with him, and declared to
<hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſes</hi> with what Complements he would accoſt him.
<hi>Eſcluſes</hi> did ſo much eſteem whatſoever <hi>Saluſt</hi> wrote, that he did keep the Copies of all his works. He had the Eclogue already written, and he came to me, and deſired me alſo to tranſcribe it, aſſuring me, that it would be a happy Prologue for a gallant Scene of Mirth to come. He informed me, that <hi>Saluſt</hi> was reſolved to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate that piece unto <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> and that before-hand we two ſhould go both of us in his place, one after the other, and affirm that our Names were both called <hi>Saluſt.</hi> It was eaſie enough to counterfeit his perſon; for as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth ſeldom make men perfect, but gives one imperfection or other to their bodies, who have an acompliſhed Spirit; ſo ſhe had made him to ſtammer, and he did write a great deal better than he did ſpeak: So <hi>Homer</hi> was blind, and <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nſard</hi> deaf, and the defects of theſe great Perſonages were repaired by the excellence of their Underſtandings. <hi>Eſcluſes</hi> having notice on what Day
<hi>Saluſt</hi> intended to give a Viſit to <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> did addreſſe himſelf unto him a little before, and in a better hour; and having found this Man of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in his Chamber, he made an humble reverence unto him. Sir, (ſaid <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59287:136"/>he) I am come hither to have the happineſſe to make a tender to you of my ſervice. I would no longer be deprived of the converſation of ſo excellent a Spirit, by which I may benefit my ſelf, and having taken ſome pains of late in the compoſure of ſome verſes, I ſhould be very glad to have your approbation. I am called
<hi>Salust,</hi> I ſhall be always ready to ſerve you, I know not if ever you have heard of me, or not. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> who had ſeen many Poems printed in that name, but had never known the Author by his face, and knew nothing elſe of him but only that he ſtammerd, did verily perſwade himſelf that it was he, and with much courteſie cauſed him to ſit down, giving him many thanks for the honour he had done him. The pretended
<hi>Saluſt</hi> did then take the Eclogue out of his Pocket, and did read it to him. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> did attempt to find one fault or other almoſt with every verſe, that ſo he might make known unto him the acuteneſſe of his apprehenſion and judgement, nevertheleſſe he affirmed at the laſt, that the beginnings of the verſes were very good, and the fancy of the Author was ſuitable to the preſent time. <hi>Eſcluſes</hi> thanked him for his patience to hear him, and having taken his leave of him, he came to find out me, to acquaint me that it was time for me to go to act the ſame perſon, and that we ſhould receive a great deal of contentment by it. He taught me the ſame Oration which he had ſpoken to <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> and I making my addreſſe unto him, did counterfeit to ſtammer ſo extremely, that I was almoſt half a quarter of an hour in bringing forth every Syllable, and I alſo told him that I was called <hi>Saluſt.</hi> He heard all this with a frowning ſilence, and ſaid but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ſeeing that in ſo great a City as <hi>Paris,</hi> it was poſſible enough that there might be two Poets of the ſame name, and that one of them might ſtammer as well as the other; but when I began to read the Eclogue to him, which was the very ſame that he heard before, he could not contain himſelf, but ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, Sir, There departed hence a Gentleman but even now, who calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>Saluſt</hi> as well as your ſelf, he ſhewed me alſo the very ſame Poem, who was it of you two that made it? Is it poſſible that you ſhould both have the ſame Genius, as well as the ſame name, and that you ſhould both write on the ſame ſubject, and which is more, have the ſelf ſame words? Upon my faith a Man may give but a bad interpretation of it; I know not who is he that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in this particular, but will you be pleaſed to take the pains to go ſome where elſe, to look out one to paſſe his cenſure on your verſes, I have been tormented with them too much already. Go ask the other <hi>Saluſt</hi> what I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready have ſaid unto him.</p>
            <p>Speaking thoſe words, I perceived that he was in a great choler, ſo that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great Ceremony I did take my leave of him. Not long afterwards the true <hi>Saluſt</hi> arrived, and made him a Complement like unto ours, at the leaſt in the ſubſtance of it, for in the grace of ſpeaking he did far excell us, and did ſtammer a great deal handſomer. He did imitate himſelf better than we could imitate him. Nevertheleſſe, when be began to tell <hi>Hortenſius</hi> that his name was <hi>Saluſt,</hi> and that he would ſhew him an Eclogue, he did thruſt him out of the Chamber with all the force he had, and if he had not ſhifted from him, he had thrown him headlong down the ſtairs. How now (ſaid he) Why this laſt is a veryer knave than the other two, and ſpeaks a great deal worſe, Will they not leave coming to me till it be night? Ah theſe are cloſe lurching Companions. Theſe are the Nimmers who would rob me of all my moveables. Who ever hereafter ſhall come to ſee me, I will not open the door till he hath told me his name, and if he ſtammers, or calls himſelf <hi>Saluſt,</hi> he ſhall not enter within my doors. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> having ſpoke this, had a ſtrong deſire to have ſet the Serjeant upon
<hi>Saluſt,</hi> to have him apprehended as a Thief, but he could find no body in his houſe to imploy on that errand.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Saluſt</hi> made all the haſt away that poſſibly he could, and we repaired directly to his houſe, to know of him, if he had ſeen <hi>Hortenſius?</hi> 
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:59287:136"/>He told us that he was with him, but the Fool was ſo furious, that he had not the patience to hear what he would ſay unto him, and that he would have beaten him without any ground at all, ſo that he though himſelf happy to have eſcaped his hands. <hi>Eſcluſes</hi> could not contain himſelf from diſcovering the trick which we had put upon him, which gave him ſo much content, that he ſaid, It was very expedient that all the three <hi>Saluſts</hi> ſhould go all together to ſee Monſieur <hi>Hortenſius.</hi> That advice did pleaſe us well, we returned to his Lodging. but he being not within, we did all go to the Printers houſe, where we did find him correcting Proofs. We deſired him that he would not be angry at our proceedings, for we were brethren, and that we all three made Verſes, but to ſpeak the truth, it was the eldeſt only who made the Eclogue. He made anſwer, I have ſince thought upon it, and am not now in ſo much choler; It ſeems to me that all you three might well make that Eclogue, and that the eldeſt did make the beginning, the ſecond the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and the younger Brother the end of it. So it was, ſaid I, but we durſt not acquaint you with it. He at that time did believe us, but afterwards our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit was diſcovered to him; whereupon he did bear us no more good will, but would rail at us in whatſoever place he did ſee us. We reſolved to take of him a pleaſant vengeance, and having obſerved, that, becauſe he would be taken for a Gentleman, he was alwayes booted and ſpurred, as was heretofore <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis de Gaul,</hi> without ever being on horſeback, we deſired to make ſport with him concerning that particular. His Boots were ſo old, that they ſeemed to be thoſe which Archbiſhop <hi>Turpin</hi> did wear, when he marched with good King
<hi>Charlem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>in</hi> againſt the
<hi>Saracens;</hi> full often had they been mended, and ſoled, and ſoled, and mended again; I believe that all the Coblers in <hi>Paris</hi> were well acquainted with them, and that there was not one amongſt them all who had not at leaſt ſet a piece or two on them. The leggs of the Boots had been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and pieced in ſo many places, that with truth enough it may be affirmed, they were not the ſame which they had been at firſt, they looked like the Boat of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> which was kept for a Monument in the Haven of <hi>Athens.</hi> Whenſoever that any new hole appeared,
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> would thruſt into it a little piece of coloured Taffaty, which it ſeems he would do on purpoſe, to make it ſhew more gallant.</p>
            <p>One day, as thus booted he walked along the Streets, we were drinking with ſome Serjeants of our acquaintance, who being half drunk, did by our perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions take him by the Collar in a little lane that did lead unto the Counter; They told him that he muſt go to Priſon for the great Treſpaſſe he committed, having hurt a child of one of the Burgeſſes of the City. He made anſwer, he knew not what they would have; nevertheleſſe they halled him to the Court <hi>Leveſque,</hi> as the Judge was then upon the Bench. He was brought before him, and a certain Man whom we had feed for that purpoſe, did put into the Court a Declaration againſt him, alleging, that <hi>Hortenſius</hi> on that morning, making his Horſe to prance and corvet in the ſtreets, had a deſign to kill a young child of his, and had thrown him on the ground, and much bruiſed his head. He deſired that proviſion might be made for the cure, and ſatisfaction given for all expences and damages, and that he might be bound to the good behaviour for the time to come.</p>
            <p>The Judge demanded of <hi>Hortenſius</hi> if this were true? He ſlatly did deny it, but durſt not at the firſt plead that he was never on horſeback becauſe he was alwayes booted; but at the laſt he was conſtrained thus to declare for himſelf, Alas Sir, How is it poſſible that I being on horſeback ſhould hurt any child, ſince I will prove unto you, that I was never on horſeback all my life? and when I did travel to my own Country, I went alwayes in a Coach; I was once being a little Boy mounted on an Aſſe, Sir, He was ſo ſawcy that he did throw me on the ground, and diſplaced a bone in my ſhoulder, ſince which time, I would never have any thing to do with Beaſts. The Iudge told him, that he <pb n="25" facs="tcp:59287:137"/>muſt produce Witneſſes that he was never on horſeback. He demanded a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reſpite of time, which was granted him; at the laſt his own Oath was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and he was releaſed from the Serjeants, paying no charges at all, but only ſome ſmall thing which he gave them to drink.</p>
            <p>Being inlarged, he was almoſt angry with himſelf that he was not eſteemed to be ſo generous,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s to be guilty of the fact for which he was accuſed, that he might make the world believe that he was not ſo deſpicable a perſon, but that ſometimes he had been on horſeback. We did imagine what he thought, and afterwards we began to make ſport with him on the brave adventure which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to him. He, ſeeing himſelf ſo laughed at, had ſo much judgement as to know, that the only means to avoid it, was not to ſeem incenſed, but to laugh with us; So that finding us one day in a Book-ſellers ſhop, as we were entring upon a diſcourſe concerning Boots, he told us, That he would make us a Speech in the praiſe of them: and to ſhew himſelf pleaſant in earneſt, he did thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, O how much are thoſe Authors to be accuſed of Negligence, who having ſearched into the Invention of things, have not left in writing who was he who firſt found out the uſe of the Boots? What a heavy and a ſtupid Spirit did poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe our Predeceſſors, as not to accommodate themſelves with ſo warm an accoutrement, but only when they were to ride abroad, contenting themſelves to walk in the Streets with Stockings and Shooes! We, who are more advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, do uſe them daily, not only when we ride, but on foot alſo; for there is nothing more profitable, eſpecially to ſave Silk ſtockings, againſt whom the Duſt and the Dirt in the Streets do make continual warr, and above all places in this City of <hi>Paris,</hi> which from <hi>Lutum,</hi> that is, Dirt, is called <hi>Lutetia.</hi> Is there not a Proverb which affirmeth, that the Pox of <hi>Roan,</hi> and the Dirt of
<hi>Paris,</hi> are near of kin to one another? Is it not a great advantage of Honor when you walk abroad, to appear (by being booted only) to be a Cavallier, although you have no Horſe at all, becauſe thoſe, whoſoever they are that ſee you, will ſuddenly be apt to imagine, that a Lackey not farr off is waiting with your Horſe for you? Thoſe of Forein Nations who live amongſt us, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed how ſo much Hay and Oats ſhould increaſe in
<hi>France,</hi> to nouriſh the Horſes of ſo many Men who do wear Boots in <hi>Paris</hi> only; but we cannot but laugh, and laugh again at their Ignorance, for we may demonſtrate to them, that the Horſes of thoſe Gentlemen whom they ſee to wear Boots, do not coſt much money to keep them. All the brave Men who are at this day booted, do declare unto us, that a Boot is an eſſential part of a Gentleman; and in this we follow the Noble
<hi>Romans,</hi> who did wear a Buskin, called in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<hi>Cothurnus,</hi> and left to the inferiour rabble the little property called
<hi>Soccus,</hi> which came no higher than the ankle, in the ſame manner as we leave ſhooes to Men only of baſe Condition. But the <hi>Romans</hi> indeed had no true Boots, but ſomething like to Boots; for had they Boots, and known their convenience, and their profit, they had erected a Temple to the honour of them, as well as to all other things which they eſteemed, and on the Altar they would have placed a God deſſe booted and ſpurred, who for her Prieſts and Sacrificers ſhould have had Curriers and Shoo-makers, and her Victims ſhould have been Cows and Bullocks, whoſe skins had been flead off to make Boots withall. But what need we prepare a Temple for them, ſince every one doth carry them about him in his heart, and on his feet; and there are ſome who have gone above three years together in one pair of Boots only, to the end only that they might appear the moſt brave, and the moſt faſhionable Men in this City? The Knights of the Round Table were alwayes ſo armed, that it ſeemed their arms were not buckled, but did grow upon their bodies. The <hi>Centaures</hi> were always on horſeback, and did ſit ſo faſt in the Saddle, that it ſeemed the Horſe and they were but one piece; and for that Cauſe the Poets feigned they were half Men and half Horſes: ſo, not to forget <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59287:137"/>the Boots, It ſeems to me that it ought to be one of our Members, and when any one is killed in war, we ſhould only ſay that he hath left off his Boots, as if they were the only reſidence of his Soul, and the eſſential part of a Cavallier, which did chooſe rather to inhabit there than in the Body; And to ſpeak the truth, it is from thence we ſhould take the courage to manage the Horſe on all occaſions, to which practice of Horſemanſhip we do often owe the ſafety of our lives.</p>
            <p>It will be here objected, that a Baron having found a Shepherdeſſe in the Fields, was ſo inamoured of her, that he did give his Horſe to his Lackey, and did take her into a private place along with him to gather a Roſe, but the Girl deſiring him that he would permit her firſt to pluck off his Boots, for fear that he might ſpoil her Coats and Stockings with the durt of them, did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pull his Boots but half off, and fled away, leaving him ſo intangled, that on the firſt ſtep he made to follow her, he fell down amongſt the thorns, which lamentably and revengfully did ſcratch and tear his face. Behold here a ſad ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is to be imputed only to his own folly, who ſuffered himſelf to be ſo much abuſed. Boots are not to be thought the worſe of for that misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; It is with thoſe the Curate doth gallop to a benefice, with thoſe the Merchant doth adventure to his Traffick, with thoſe the Lovers do ride to ſee their Miſtreſſes. There is a neceſſity for gallant men to wear them, if they will appear to be that which they are, and for other men to wear them alſo, if they will appear to be that which they are not. If a man be cloathed in black, he is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a Citizen, if he be in colours, he is taken for a Player on the Viol, or peradventure for ſome Judggler, ſpecially if he wears ſilk ſtockings of a colour different from his cloaths, but if he hath Boots on, it doth enrich and ennoble all manner of habiliments. Let no man blame me therefore for being Booted, if he will not appear to be of a Spirit Heteroclital.</p>
            <p>This was the ſubſtance of the demonſtrative Oration which
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> made for Boots, and I would I could remember the Latine paſſages which he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with it. We pretended that we did like it excellently well, and the firſt time afterwards that <hi>Eſcluſes</hi> ſaw him, he preſented him with theſe verſes on the ſame ſubject.</p>

            <p>O how theſe Verſes were pleaſing to <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> who believed that <hi>Eſclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> did highly eſteem him! he loved him after that better than other men, and <pb n="27" facs="tcp:59287:138"/>my fine Poet continuing to diſſemble, obtained of him whatſoever he deſired. They never ſtirred from one another, and it ſeemed to me that they two were but one. Nevertheleſſe their friendſhip at laſt began to diminiſh.
<hi>Ecluſes</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving communicated ſome verſes to
<hi>Hortenſius,</hi> the Pedant did not approve them, and the other maintained they were good. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> told him that he did not underſtand any thing at all, and that he ought not to ſpeak any more to him, for you muſt underſtand that he thought himſelf knowing and able e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to read a Leſſon to us all, and believed that he was our King.
<hi>Ecluſes</hi> alſo who at other times was pleaſed to allow him that title, or whatſoever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he would arrogate to himſelf, could not at that time contain himſelf within the bounds, of ſilence or of complacence, but told <hi>Hortenſius</hi> that he was as able every way as himſelf, which did put him into ſuch a choler, that with violence he cauſed him to go out of his Chamber, and threatned to beat him, if he ſhould perſiſt any longer againſt him. <hi>Eſcluſes</hi> addreſſed himſelf to me, to acquaint me with the quarrel that was betwixt them; I told him, that it was not well done of him, ſeeing <hi>Hortenſius</hi> had lent him money, and done him many other courteſies, and that he muſt not fall out with him, if he would not have it to be believed, that one of them was of as bad a humour as the other, and that it belonged to his diſcretion to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and paſſe by offences. This did prevail ſo much upon him, that on the next morning he very early repaired to <hi>Hortenſius</hi> to make his peace with him. He was then in bed, but his Servitor opened the door for him, and
<hi>Eſcluſes</hi> being entred into the Chamber did ſpeak thus unto him, I muſt ſincerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe (Monſieur <hi>Hortenſius</hi>) that in your works you are more than a Man, but in your choler you are worſe than a Beaſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> feeling himſelf touched, did riſe out of the Bed in a red Cap, and a red Waſtcoat, and made anſwer to him, If I am a Beaſt, I am that Beaſt of the Paradiſe of Mahomet, who hath Eyes of

<hi>Chryſolite,</hi> the <hi>Onix,</hi> and the <hi>Beriil.</hi> If you have all thoſe pretious ſtones (ſaid <hi>Eſclnſes</hi>) I do vow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, you are the braveſt, and the richeſt Beaſt in the world. I tell you moreover (ſaid <hi>Hortenſius</hi>) If I am a Beaſt, I am one of thoſe Beaſts of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who give light unto the Earth, as the <hi>Bear,</hi> the
<hi>Dragon,</hi> the <hi>Swan,</hi> the <hi>Pegaſus</hi> the <hi>Crab,</hi> the <hi>Scorpion,</hi> the <hi>Capricorn,</hi> the <hi>Whale,</hi> the
<hi>Centaure,</hi> and the <hi>Hydra.</hi> He made ſuch a ſound with thoſe words, and ſmiled as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced them, as if he had ſpoken ſome excellent thing. <hi>Eſcluſes</hi> made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I doubt not of the truth of that which you ſpeak, but which of thoſe Beaſts doe you moſt reſemble? Do you crawl backwards as a <hi>Crab,</hi> or have you horns in your Forehead as the <hi>Capricorn? Hortenſius</hi> replyed, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared himſelf to the <hi>Swan,</hi> and <hi>Eſcluſes</hi> indeavouring to turn all into an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding mirth, <hi>Hortenſius</hi> did grow again into a great choler. At the ſame inſtant I arrived, and made them both friends; Nevertheleſſe I could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a right underſtanding betwixt them, and <hi>Hortenſius</hi> hating
<hi>Eſcluſes,</hi> would hate alſo all thoſe who did keep him company, inſomuch that I was in the number of his Enemies, which was the occaſion that I contrived a way to make my ſelf merry with him.</p>
            <p>One day walking on the New-bridge, I ſaw a man on Horſeback towards the <hi>Auguſtines,</hi> who had on him a furred Coat, a Taffety Cloak, a Sword hanging on his right ſide, and a Hatband made of Teeth, which were filled all to one evenneſſe; His garb was as antick as his Habit, ſo that I ſtood ſtill a while to look upon him: He ſtayed at the foot of the Bridge, and although there were not any one near unto him, he began to ſpeak in this manner, and to ask queſtions of his Horſe for want of better company, Come hither my <pb n="28" facs="tcp:59287:138"/>Horſe, and tell me, Wherefore is it that we are come into this place? If thou kneweſt how to ſpeak, thou wouldeſt make anſwer, To do ſervice to all honeſt people. But ſome one will ſay unto me, Gentleman of <hi>Italy,</hi> in what is it that you can be ſerviceable to us? To draw your teeth (Gentlemen) without putting you to any pain at all, and to put others in their places, with which you may eat as well as with teeth naturally your own. And with what doſt thou pluck them out? With the point of a Sword? No Gentlemen, That way is too old. It it with this which I hold in my hand And what is it which thou holdeſt in thy hand, Signior of <hi>Italy?</hi> My horſes bridle, Gentlemen. This Tooth-drawer had no ſooner begun this goodly Oration, but a Porter, a Lacky, a Woman that cryed Cherries, three that cryed Mackarel, two Apprentices, a Ragg-man and a ſeller of Almanacks, did all ſtand ſtill to hear him. For my ſelf (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending as though I looked upon ſome of thoſe old Books which the Bookſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers do there commonly lay forth upon their Stalls) I did liſten to him as well as the reſt. Having ſo many venerable Auditors he re-inforced his eloquence, and did continue in theſe words, Who is he that draws out the teeth of Kings and Princes? Is it the Carmelite? Or the <hi>Engliſh</hi> man in the yellow Ruff? Is it Maſter <hi>Arnault?</hi> who to make the world believe that he is a Tooth drawer for Potentates, hath painted about his own Picture the Pope and all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory of Cardinals, every one of them with a black plaiſter above his temple, repreſenting thereby, that none of them are exempted from the Tooth ache; No, No, It is not he. Who is it then that draweth out the teeth of thoſe great Princes? It is the <hi>Italian</hi> Gentleman whom you ſee. It is my ſelf (Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.) It is I. I it is who am the Man. He did ſpeak that ſhewing himſelf in a full body to them all, and laying his hand upon his Breſt. Many other foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he repreſented, and asked all the queſtions of himſelf, and undertook to deliver himſelf in pure <hi>Italian,</hi> when he was by his birth no other than a
<hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> To hear him ſpeak, it you could but believe him, as well as hear him, there is not any one who would have a tooth any longer in his head. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented a Beggar to them from whom he had taken ſix teeth, he had put them in but a little before, and holding ſomething in his mouth which was moiſt, and of a red complexion, he ſeemed alwayes to be ſpitting of bloud. Gentlemen (ſaid the Mountebank) I cure the Souldiers for courteſie, the Poor for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and the rich Merchants for money. You may ſee what it is to have a tooth vitiated, rotten, or corrupted. You will go to a Senator to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend your Sute unto him, you begin to open your Cauſe, he turns aſide from you, and cryes out, Oh the putrefaction! Withdraw my Friend, your breath is very noyſome, he will not endure to come near to hear you, and ſo your Cauſe is loſt. But you will ſay unto me, Have you any Remedy for it? Yes, Gentlemen, I have, and for many other Inconveniences: I have a Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada to make fair the skin, It is white as Snow, and odoriferous as Balm or Musk. See here my Boxes, This great one will coſt you eight Souſes, the little one with the writing, five; I have an excellent Oyntment for all wounds, If any one be hurt, I can cure him; I am neither Phyſician, Doctor, nor Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, but my Oyntment is as ſoveraign, and can do as much, as all the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, Doctors, and Phyſicians in the world; Experience is better than bare knowledge and the Practick than the Theory.</p>
            <p>Whiles the Mountebank did thus extoll his own Art, many honeſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple gathered about him, and amongſt others, <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> whom I well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. I immediatly entertained an Invention to make him the Ladder on which my mirth ſhould climb, I ſtayed there not long after; for the Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawer was conſtrained to retire. There came another Mountebank on horſeback who laughed him to ſcorn, and did ſtrike at him with the flat of his Sword. Since they were both ſo cunning, and ſo prompt in the drawing of Teeth, I knew not why in a revengefull emulation, they might not draw one
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59287:139"/>another off their Horſes, I hoped they would have done it, but our <hi>Italian</hi> fled, and would appear no more, giving place unto the other.</p>
            <p>One Morning I repaired to him with <hi>Eſcluſes,</hi> and ſaid unto him, Sir, there is a Kinſman of ours who is much troubled with the pain of his Teeth, we have adviſed him to have them drawn, but he is ſo extremely fearfull, that we cannot prevail upon him to reſolve upon it; He ſaith, that you will put him to torment, although that very lately he hath ſeen you to take our many Teeth without any pain at all, a little beneath the Bridge. Alas, Sir, ſaid the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanck, I will not put him to any pain, If you pleaſe that I ſhall preſently take out one of your Teeth, you ſhall perceive how ſwift and eaſie is my hand. No (ſaid I) I will believe you rather, But our Kinſman is afraid that having no teeth, he cannot chew his meat for the time to come, nor pronounce his words ſo pleaſingly as now he doth. If you provide for that inconvenience by artificial teeth, you will do him a greater pleaſure than he is yet ſenſible of, in delivering him from ſo great a torment; I know the man very well, and he would with all his heart that it were done, therefore we do deſire you to go to him, and whether he will or no, to take out thoſe teeth that are ſo painfull to him. You are ſo excellent at it, that when he but opens his mouth to ſpeak unto you, you may draw them out, and he never ſo much as think of what you are doing. That being done, he will pay you very thankfully, if not, we will ſee you ſatisfied our ſelves. The Mountebanck believing our words, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with the houſe in which <hi>Hortenſius</hi> lodged, and the Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banck foreſeeing the difficulties that might enſue, did take with him two Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers to accompany him, and, if need were, to aid him in his enterpriſe. <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> who would take any pains for a livelyhood, had with him four Scholars who were Penſioners and were then going to the College of <hi>Bon Court.</hi> He cauſed them to repeat their Leſſon when theſe people entred in. Sir, ſaid the Mountebanck, your Kinſmen have told me that you have teeth which do put you to great torment, Is it your pleaſure that I ſhould draw them? Who I (ſaid <hi>Hortenſius</hi>) I have better teeth Sirrah than thy ſelf, thou miſtakeſt me for another. No (ſaid the Mountebanck) It was told me that you would conceal the pain you endure, that I might not draw them out, but I am commanded to eaſe you for ever of that torment, I muſt perform it. Boys, hold him faſt, and open his mouth as wide as you can, I will put you, Sir, to ſuch little pain, that you ſhall not feel it at all. The two Voluntiers whom he brought along with him, did begin to take him by the arms, according to their inſtructions, but he did beat them back, and did ſtrike at them with all the force he had whereupon the Mountebanck ſaid unto the Scholars, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, Aſſiſt us, I beſeech you, I muſt pluck out your Maſters teeth, I have a command laid on me ſo to do, It ought to be done, and he would be very glad of it himſelf, but he fears that I ſhould hurt him, and I will not put him to the leaſt pain in the world; The Scholars believing it, did begin to take hold of their Maſter, and he had much to do to clear himſelf from ſo many hands. At the laſt he ſaid unto them, What! Be you alſo againſt me? Do you not ſee what bold Impoſtors theſe are who affront me? If you will not defend me, I will complain to your Fathers of you. Speaking thoſe words, they did let him alone, and all turned upon the Mountebanck, and his two Companions, and not without ſome difficulty they did beat them away; <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi> took a good Cudgel, with which he ſtruck the Mountebanck, and forced him to go out of doors with his retinue, who durſt not defend him againſt a man who was ſtronger than themſelves, being in his own houſe, and upon his own defence. The Voluntiers being in the ſtreet demanded of the Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banck their hire for their good ſervice they had done. He told them, that he had received no money at all, and conteſted ſo much with them that they did fall upon him to beat him, and had broken his head if the Neighbours had not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59287:139"/>interpoſed and parted them. I know not well how it was with the Tooth-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but <hi>Hortenſius</hi> afterwards took great pleaſure when any mention was made of this adventure.</p>
            <p>He knew not that I had any hand in this affair, ſo that one day meeting me in <hi>Paris,</hi> he did accoſt me, and made his complaint that he did not ſee me oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. I made anſwer to him, that I had made a little journey out of the City, and was ready to make a greater, for I was determined to go into <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Journey pleaſed him ſo well, that he would goe along with me, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming all the intereſts which he had in <hi>France.</hi> He believed that this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and eſpecially this City, being full of Prelats, that good Letters would be more acceptable, and that he ſhould be more eſteemed in <hi>Rome,</hi> than when he was at <hi>Paris.</hi> For my ſelf, who am not ſo moving and ſo haſty as <hi>Eſcluſes,</hi> I have travelled all the whole journey in great peace with him, and have not laughed openly at his extravagancies, but on the contrary have modeſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him for ſome faults, and above all, have indeavoured to make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon his pedantick humours, and thoſe ſcattered Latin Rubricks, with which he always intermingles his diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Audebert</hi> having in this manner finiſhed his Hiſtory of <hi>Hortenſius, Francion</hi> intreated him to give him an aſſurance when he ſhould ſee him; he affirmed, that he did highly eſteem of him, to the end that he might come more freely to give him a viſit, and to have ſome paſtime with him. <hi>Raymond</hi> alſo and <hi>Dorini</hi> had a great deſire to ſee ſo rare a perſonage, inſomuch that
<hi>Audebert</hi> made a promiſe to them to bring him with him as ſoon as poſſibly he could. They had all a deſign to make him the ſubject of their pleaſure, as heretofore they had done, in which there was nothing for which they might be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. All that we ſhall collect ſerveth only to laugh at the impertinence of ſome fooliſh and preſumptuous perſons, and there ſhall nothing be contained in this ſtory that ſhall give the leaſt offence to the moſt ſcrupulous apprehenſions; you ſhall find no more conceits but only of innocent mirth in all the following Hiſtory, where the moſt cunning having deceived many others, ſhall at the laſt be met with and paid in their own Coyn, which may inſtruct us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value none, and to live our ſelves a more governed life.</p>

            <head>THE ELEVENTH BOOK OF THE COMICAL HISTORY OF
<hi>FRANCION.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>HOrtenſius</hi> was ſo well perſwaded by
<hi>Audebert,</hi> that on the next morning he came to give a viſit to
<hi>Francion,</hi> who received him with many teſtimonies of joy. This brave Maſter thought yet to have found him his Scholar, to whom he might have taught many important Leſſons, inſomuch that to ſhew him he was incomparably able to perform it, he affected certain Phraſes which he had learn'd by heart, to ſerve him on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. How my brave
<hi>Francion!</hi> (thus he begun) I believed that you could no more eaſily remove from <hi>Paris,</hi> than could the Arſenac or the Palace, and that we ſhould ſee you as conſtantly at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> as the Stones of the great Stairs, or the Hall of the <hi>Switzers. Francion,</hi> to give him an exchange by a Complement like unto it, did reply unto him, I conceived, grave
<hi>Hortenſius,</hi> that we ſhould have found you to continue as long in the Vniverſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> as the <hi>Well Certain,</hi> or as the Schools of the Decrees, or the Kitchin of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melites,</hi> or Monſieur <hi>Royer,</hi> the <hi>Diogenes</hi> of the Age. You ſee (replyed
<hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi>) I am come hither to rank my ſelf near unto thoſe who apparel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the colour of Roſes, and to whom the objects moſt gratefull to the eyes are not diſtaſtefull; But Sir, I am informed you only are come hither to make love, and to renounce that Liberty which was as dear unto you as the Republick of <hi>Venice.</hi> Have you ſuffer'd your ſelf to loſe a thing, for which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> fifty years together have made War with the King of <hi>Spain?</hi> You love ſome Beauty, who in the height of the Combat will let the arms fall down from the hands even of Monſieur <hi>du Mayn</hi> himſelf. I muſt confeſſe unto you (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) the truth in ſome part of that which you have ſpoken; but not that I am like to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> or to the
<hi>Hollanders:</hi> Thoſe Compariſons are too farre removed; but, I beſeech you, let us go up unto the Chamber of Count <hi>Raymond,</hi> who will be very glad to ſee you, We will there diſcourſe more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of our affairs.</p>
            <p>Thereupon <hi>Buiſſon</hi> and <hi>Audebert,</hi> who were with <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> did go up the ſtairs without any Intreaty; but
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> could not be perſwaded to go up before
<hi>Francion,</hi> ſo courteous and ſo humble he was. Monſieur, (ſaid
<hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi>) Be pleaſed to go before, you need to have a greater Virtue than pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to follow after me. I have been ſick during the time of my travel. I have no leggs left me, but only by the way of civil deportment to make my reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to my Betters. My Body is as diſeaſed as if it were the Popes; and at <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59287:140"/>ſix and thirty years, I am no leſſe ruined than is the Caſtle of <hi>Oſtend,</hi> I am more old than my Grandmother, and as much uſed as a Veſſel which thrice hath made a Voyage to the <hi>Indies. Francion</hi> ſmiling, ſaid unto him, Sir, If you had ſaid that you had beed uſed as much as the great Cauldron of the Friers, would not the ſimilitude be better? Mock not, I beſeech you (ſaid
<hi>Hortenſius</hi>) for on my faith, neither in the Deſerts of
<hi>Africa,</hi> nor at the Fair of Saint <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> is there ſo cruel a Monſter to be ſeen, as hath been my ſickneſſe; But for your part, Sir, you have ſo ſtrong a Body, and ſo impregnable againſt all Diſeaſes, that nothing is capable to alter it, unleſſe the fall of ſome Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhould overthrow you. You are able of your ſelf to people Colonies. All this is nothing (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) your Excuſes are not valuable; If you will not go up the ſtairs of your own accord, I proteſt unto you I muſt help you as I come up after you. I muſt beſeech you put me not to that Trouble. I would have you know, that there is no Honor which I do not owe unto your merit. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> replyed, Sir, you but teach me that which I ſhould ſpeak my ſelf, Will you not give me leave to know my ſelf, and that I ſhould forget my own Name, as if I were ſome Pope? Sir, I muſt profeſſe unto you, that you are more fill'd with Complements and Ceremonies, than the Old Teſtament, or the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> Let me ſtay upon theſe Stairs till the end of the World, I ſhall defend my ſelf from that Enemy well enough, who throws nothing but Roſes on my head, and beats me not, but with a Foxes tail. Let us not diſcourſe then of the Pope, or of his Court (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) we are now at <hi>Rome,</hi> where we muſt be wiſe whether we will or no. Are you not afraid of the Inquiſition? Not I, ſaid <hi>(Hortenſius)</hi> I fear it not. Let them make never ſo many terrible Pictures, and Figures full of Tigers and Serpents, my Innocence ſhall out-live them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Raymond,</hi> who from his Chamber underſtood that theſe Gentlemen were in their long Ceremonies, did come down the Stairs, and made
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> to go up firſt, whether he would or not.
<hi>Francion</hi> ſaid unto him, Sir, We ought to give extraordinary entertainment to this rare perſonage, who is the only ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of
<hi>France.</hi> Ah Sir (ſaid <hi>Hortenſius!</hi>) turning towards him, I beſeech you to have a juſt regard to whom you attribute theſe terms of
<hi>only, rare,</hi> and <hi>extraordinary,</hi> for they are proper to the Sun, the Comets, or ſome Creatures of ſtupendious excellence. I ſhut my ears to theſe praiſes, as I do my doors to Enemies and Thieves. Let us rather diſpute of your merit, I muſt profeſſe that you are more eloquent than all the Parlaments, Preſidentiaries, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſchals, or the ſubalternate Courts of Iuſtice in <hi>France.</hi> When you lodged in Saint
<hi>Iames</hi> his Street, you were the moſt able man that lived there, no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſe to the <hi>Iacobins,</hi> or the <hi>Ieſuiſts. Francion</hi> replyed, you flatter me too much. Speak no more of me, Let us talk of
<hi>Raymond</hi> and <hi>Buiſſon.</hi> What ſhall I ſay of them (replyed <hi>Hortenſius</hi>) but that they are the two rare workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of Nature? If all the world were like unto them, the Univerſities would be the moſt unprofitable part of the Commonwealth, and Latin (as the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment at <hi>Milan</hi>) would be rather a witneſſe of our Luxury, than an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of our Neceſſity. <hi>Francion</hi> made anſwer, You do not give them now that Honor which is due unto them, to imply that they underſtand not Latin; but ſuppoſe they ſhould not know it, and ſhould undervalue it, as the greateſt part of the Court do at this day, muſt we therefore ſay that Latin is improfitable? Think better of your antient Livelihood, I beſeech you, and conſider, that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin ought not to have the leaſt mixture with any riotous entertainment. When <hi>Francion</hi> ſpoke this, he ſo ſmiled withall, that <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was not offended, who ſtill continued to ſet forth his Eloquence, the new ſtile whereof aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed all the world.</p>
            <p>He came at laſt to ſpeak of the pleaſures at <hi>Rome,</hi> concerning which he had many extravagant expreſſions. He ſaid, that the Servants ſprinkled ſo much <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59287:141"/>Sweet-water in his Chamber, that he was even glad to ſwim to ſave his own life; that the Muſcats he did eat were ſo great, that only one grain of them was enough to make all
<hi>England</hi> to be perpetually drunk; And ſpeaking of the Miſtreſſe of <hi>Francion,</hi> he ſaid, that he eſteemed her to be moſt happy to have captivated him, and preferred that Victory of hers, above all thoſe of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> or of <hi>Henry the Great.</hi> But he ſaid he nouriſhed an infectious fear, that in often ſeeing of <hi>Francion,</hi> he ſhould at the laſt become amorous, as <hi>Fr ncion</hi> was, and that he ſhould not be able to look upon a handſom Beggar, without ſome ſecret deſires; and moreover he was highly afraid that he ſhould fall in love at laſt with ſome diſdainfull Creature, who having flattered him to his deſtruction, and thrown him down the Precipice, would ſay unto him in the end of all, <hi>God ſave thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After that, they came to diſcourſe of Books, and he affirmed they were the greateſt part of them ſo ill made, that after the ordinary Ballads, and the Bills of Quackſalvers, he found nothing ſo ill. For his own part, he had ſought out all the Remedies that could be imagined againſt the Ignorance of the Age, and perfectly had found out an elaborate Idea of Eloquence. He uſed moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many extraordinary terms, that
<hi>Francion</hi> could not with any patience have endured him, if he had continued to ſpeak as he had begun; for there was nothing in the whole compoſition of his ſtile, but ſtrange Hyperboles, and Compariſons drawn from far, that they much reſembled the ravings of a Man in a Feaver, or the Language of the Emperor of the Corn-cutters. What, ſaid
<hi>Hortenſius,</hi> Do you find defects and blemiſhes in the face of the Sun? It is a long time (you know) ſince I have excelled all others, and have found out that, which they in vain have ſought for. They who will not believe me, let them erre amongſt the Turks and Infidels, who are the greateſt part of the World. Take heed what you ſpeak (ſaid <hi>Buiſſon,</hi>) one may prove by the ſame Conſequence, that if the Pope and the <hi>Capuchins</hi> do not praiſe your works, they ſhall be taken to be as very Turks as
<hi>Amurath,</hi> or <hi>Bajazet;</hi> which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous to allege. Do you make it an Article of Faith to believe that you write well?
<hi>Hortenſius,</hi> with a forced laughter, did reply, Be ſilent, vulgar Spirit, and know, that my Works are worthy to be laid on the faireſt Beds of
<hi>France;</hi> but take heed (ſaid <hi>Buiſſon</hi>) that it be not on the beds of thoſe who have taken Phyſick, and will take your Books along with them to their Stool of Office.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Raymond,</hi> obſerving they began to grow into words, did take off their cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, by putting them on another Subject, and demanded of
<hi>Hortenſius,</hi> If he had not wherewith to make them to paſs their time away with pleaſure; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſhewed them a Book of his, in which he derided whatſoever the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents had written. <hi>Francion</hi> did importunately intreat him that homight ſee it, ſo that being no longer able to reſiſt him, he ſaid unto them, Gentlemen, To give you a ſight of ſmall pieces, as Letters, or Sonnets, I will not do it at this preſent, I will ſpeak unto you of a Romance, which is better than all Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; for even my diſtempers are of more worth than the meditations of the Philoſophers. I will do that which hath yet never entred into the thought of mortal man. You know that ſome Wiſe men have affirmed, that there are many worlds, which ſome have placed in the Planets, and others in the fixed Starrs; For my part, I believe that there is a world in the Moon. Thoſe ſpots which we ſee in the face thereof when ſhe is full, I do conceive to be the Earth, and that there are Caves, and Foreſts, and Iſles, and other things which are not fully repreſented; but the places which are reſplendent are the Seas, which being clear, do receive the light of the Sun, as doth the brightneſſe of a Mirror. Take heed (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) what it is which you affirm; The Earth which you ſpeak of, is the ſame Earth wherein we are, and he who ſpeaketh of things done here, will appear too vulgar. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> made anſwer, I will deſcribe

            <p>There will be a Prince as ambitious as <hi>Alexander,</hi> who ſhall come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer this world; He ſhall make great proviſion of Engins, either to deſcend, or to aſcend (for to ſpeak the truth, I do not yet know whether we are above that world, or beneath) He ſhall bring with him another <hi>Archimides,</hi> who ſhall make him all manner of ſtructures, and ladders, by the means whereof he ſhall enter into the Epycicle of the Moon excentrick to our Earth, and there it ſhall be where he ſhall ſind ſome place habitable, where ſhall be Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unknown, whom he ſhall overcome. From thence he ſhall tranſport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the great Orb, ſloping to the part Epicycle, where he ſhall find vaſt fields which ſhall be peopled only by Monſters; And purſuing his adventures, he ſhall tilt with the Cavalliers along the Eccliptick line. After that he ſhall viſit the two <hi>Coluri,</hi> and the Meridian Circle, where he ſhall meet with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gallant metamorphoſes, but approaching too near the Sun, he and his people ſhall gain a malady, for which God hath provided no remedy but poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and precipices. He ſhall have a feaver upon him which ſhall burn ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, that if the antient Tyrants and Pagan Princes had heard of it, they would have tormented the Martyres with it, and never expoſed them to the bitings of venimous beaſts.</p>
            <p>This is the end which I will put unto this work, which ſhall laſt as long as Nature her ſelf, in ſpite of the envious and malicious ſpirits that ſhall condemn it. Conſider now with your ſelf if theſe are not the ſtrains of a tranſcendent underſtanding. All the Company were ſurprized with amazement to hear ſuch grand extravancies, and to receive yet greater pleaſure from <hi>Hortenſius, Raymond</hi> ſeeming to admire him, did ſay unto him, Certainly I never heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing ſo divine, as is this which you relate unto us; I would to God, that as you have given us now, but as it were the firſt draughts of it, you would be pleaſed another time, to give us the more full ſight thereof in all its parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. It is enough for this preſent (ſaid <hi>Hortenſius</hi>) I will now deliver ſome other obſervations of Importance to you. Know then, that if the world doth ſeem unto us to be great. our bodies do appear in compariſon of it to be no bigger than an Apple, or a Ball. Now there is no body ſo little which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be divided into innumerable parts, ſo that it may be, that within ſuch, or ſuch a little Body, there may be yet leſſe Creatures, and ſo little, that they may live there, as in a ſpacious world, and poſſibly they may be little men, to whom ſome good fortunes anſwerable to the proportion of their bodies do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew. In this conſideration there is not ſo little nor ſo deſpicable a part of the Univerſe where we may not imagine but there are little worlds. I will make a Romance of the adventures of their people; I will ſing of their loves, and of their wars, and the revolution of their Empires; and above all, I will ſtudy to repreſent the Eſtate where people may be which inhabit the body of Man, and I will demonſtrate, that not without great reaſon the Body of Man is called a Microcoſm. I will have another treatiſe by it ſelf, where all the Members of the Body ſhall ſhew their diſagreement or complyance with one another. The Arms and the Hands ſhall make war againſt the Feet, and the Thighs and Eyes ſhall make love to the Privy Members, the Veins to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and the Bones unto the Marrow. This is not all, I have yet an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſign in my Fancy which ſhall take away the glory from <hi>Argenis</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

All their houſes ſhall be builded with the moſt pretious ſtones and pearls. There ſhall be alſo Parks and Forreſts of <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59287:142"/>Corall, where they ſhall go to hunt the green Cod, the Herring, and other Fiſhes. The Trees for the moſt part ſhall be of Ruſhes, and plants, of the moſt tender growth, and if there ſhall chance to be any battail or Turnaments, the Lances ſhall be of the prickles of Roſes.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was ſpeaking theſe words,
<hi>Francion,</hi> deſiring to witneſſe that he was rapt with admiration, did begin to cry out, O my God! what rich in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions are theſe? How infortunate were the Antients not to have been born in theſe times, to hear ſuch excellent things? and how ſorry will our Nephews be, that they came into the world too late to have ſeen you, and to have been acquainted with you? But it is true howſoever, that the beſt part of you, that is your divine writings, ſhall ſtill live, and ſhall flouriſh amongſt them. O
<hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> an unfortunate City to have loſt ſuch an incomparable wit, and happy art thou, O City of <hi>Rome,</hi> to have procured it. You underſtand not all (ſaid <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi>) I have other deſigns wherewith to raviſh the world. Know, that I have ſo many Romances to compoſe, that I am even diſtracted in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of them: Contemplating of them in my Chamber, me thinks they be always about me in viſible forms, like ſo many little Devils, and that one of them pulls me by the Ear, another by the Noſe, a third by the Breeches, and the fourth by the Garters, and that every one ſays unto me, Monſieur <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius,</hi> make me firſt, I am the faireſt, and do promiſe beſt, Begin with me, and having begun, go through with it, leave not me for another. Upon my faith (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) me thinks I now underſtand the Fable of theſe Fairies. It is ſaid that when they go to the ſtool they do do nothing but Musk, and when they do render their Urine, they make the water of Angels, if they ſpit or blow their Noſes, from their Mouths, and from their Noſes there doth proceed E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meraulds and Pearls, and when they waſh their hands, inſtead of foul water, there doth fall down into the Baſin pretious ſtones. I believe the ſame in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry action which <hi>Hortenſius</hi> doth, he doth drop books unto us when he doth go to eaſe the burthen of Nature, They are his Tranſlations, if he but blowes his Noſe, there comes a Hiſtory from it, and if he ſpetteth, he ſpetteth nothing but Romances. I will avow all to be true which you ſpeak (ſaid <hi>Hontenſius</hi>) for you ſpeak only by a Figure, and to expreſſe my facility of writing: You are ſtill in your old skin, and full of upbraiding mirth, But to demonſtrate to you that all that which I ſpeak is not mockery, I will give you a ſight of the firſt draught which I have made of my Romances of the Epicycle, and of that of the parts of the Body, for I travail at one time with two or three things as well as <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having ſpoken this, he did put his hand into his pocket, and did take out a Key, a diſcoloured and ſweaty pair of Gloves, a ſoul Handkerchief, and ſome papers as greaſie as the Bill of the long expences of a Cook. He turned the leaves over, but could not find that which he looked for, ſo that he did begin to put it all up again, affirming that he would ſhew them that rich piece ſome other time. In putting them up, he did let fall ſome few of his Papers, but he was ſo tranſported with the joy he received to hear himſelf ſo exceſſively praiſed, that he did not mind it. <hi>Francion</hi> took them up with his own hands, without ſpeaking any word, with an intention to read them at his leiſure; And the better to divert him, he asked him who were the beſt writers who at that time had the Vogue in
<hi>Paris.</hi> Do not you know them as well as I my ſelf? ſaid
<hi>Hortenſius,</hi> there are too many commended who are more worthy to be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: You have at the Court three or four young fellows, who make verſes more fit for a Ballad, or ſome ordinary ſong, than for a Courtiers ear; They have never read any other Books, but the <hi>Delights of the French Poeſie,</hi> and are ſo extremely ignorant, that it is impoſſible to be more. Moreover, there are 5 or 6 ſilly knaves, who gain a livelyhood by writing Romances, there are no other as I know of but an Uſher of mine who following me hath ſerved the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſts, <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59287:142"/>and doth delight himſelf by dabling in the Ink to defile white paper, His chief Eſſay hath been the Collection of <hi>Tabarins</hi> forced Speeches, which ſo long time did charm the ears of the brazen Horſe, a Book that did find ſo quick a Market, that Twenty thouſand of them have been ſold, when the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of a good Book, although there are but ſix hundred of them, will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be vented; but there are more people you know who buy Herring, than freſh Salmon, and Buckrom, than Sattin. Fools are in a greater number than Wiſe men.</p>
            <p>This Uſher of mine calleth himſelf <hi>Guilliaum,</hi> and in the firſt Romance that ever he printed, you ſhall find that he was well contented with that Sirname; but a year afterwards, having compoſed another Book, which he dedicated to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> he would appear amongſt the Nobility, and therefore in the Title he ſaith, Compoſed by
<hi>Seiur de Guilliaum,</hi> to the end that the ſyllable <hi>de</hi> might perſwade us to believe that he is a Gentleman; but the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Aſſe doth not perceive, that it is not ſo much grace to put this Prepoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>De</hi> before the Name of a Sain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, as before the Name of a Signiory, and is not afraid that the Saints ſhould take offence, and puniſh him for it, becauſe they never did affect the vanity of the Honours of the world. Beſides that, my fine Uſher did play another prank as ridiculous as the former, He took up a Sattin Suit at the Brokers, to preſent his Book, to the end that at the Court he might be taken for a Gentleman, and if the Queen had not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him his Reward preſently, he durſt not, by reaſon of his ill habit, have returned any more to the <hi>Louvre</hi> to proſecute his Sute. But he ought not to make any difficulty at it, or to be aſhamed at all; for the ſight of his ragged cloaths would have moved pity, and ſomething indeed would have been rather contributed to him by the way of Alms. He hath cauſed other things to be printed, for he hath taken old books &amp; changed 3 or 4 lines at the beginning, &amp; cauſed them to be afterwards printed with new titles, to abuſe the people; but I ſwear unto you, if I were one of the Judges, I would puniſh as grievouſly ſuch falſifiers of books, as thoſe who coyn falſe mony, or do counterfeit Obligations and Contracts. To conclude, my Servant hath written already more than my ſelf; but his Books be all good for nothing elſe, but to wrap up butter in them; and it is ſaid, that the laſt winter the Butter-women had a deſire to go all together to him, to give him thanks that he made proviſion for them, when the Leaves of the Vines failed. The Parlament nevertheleſſe, who regard not their particular profit, ſhould, for their greater honour, have condemned him to drink as much Ink as he hath ill imployed, and I would have him to take a full Cup of it from the hands of the Hangman. There are others worthy of the ſame puniſhment, but for their own defence they will all ſay, as he who was to be baſtinadoed for having ſtollen away a Romance from Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and afterwards cauſed it to be printed, Woe is me! Pardon me I beſeech you, that which I have done was only to procure me bread. I had no Intention of my ſelf to doe evill. But let us have Pence amongſt our ſelves, and diſcourſe no more of this. I would not that my Eloquence ſhould be as pernitious as the Beauty of <hi>Helena,</hi> I underſtand well enough the viſages of the <hi>Hebrides,</hi> and cachochimichal humors, and erroneous pretences, and Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets cloathed in the skins of Lions, for they never change their habits, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the people with their diſtempers to procure themſelves a little bread, and nevertheleſſe do cauſe themſelves to be painted with a Crown of Laurel on their heads, as if they were thoſe illuſtrious perſonages whoſe lifes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by
<hi>Plutarch,</hi> or as if they had gotten the priſe in the
<hi>Olympick</hi> games. Another time I will ſpeak more unto them, I will then thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der againſt them, and condemn them to the Galleys, becauſe they are ſo unprofitable to the world; An Oar would do better in their hands than a Pen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59287:143"/>This Diſcourſe of <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arre more agreeable to the Company than all the other which he made; but this would not prevail to cauſe his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to entertain a good opinion of him, and <hi>Francion,</hi> with impatience deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to peruſe thoſe papers which he had taken from him, did begin to look upon them, and found they were leaves which he had torn out of other looks. <hi>Hertenſius</hi> obſerving him to read, and by the faſhion of the leaves conjecturing what they were, ſaid unto him, Ah Monſieur, I beſeech you to reſtore thoſe Papers unto me. I will by and by, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> but I will firſt read them over. No, replyed
<hi>Hortenſius,</hi> I will give you whatſoever you will deſire of me, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that you will not read thoſe papers. And I, ſaid
<hi>Francion,</hi> will give you whatſoever you ſhall deſire of me, if you will but give me leave to read them over. Speaking thoſe words, he locked up himſelf in a Wardrobe with <hi>Raymond,</hi> and having peruſed thoſe looſe and printed ſheets, he found the greateſt part of thoſe Phraſes in them, which <hi>Hortenſius</hi> had that day ſpoken. He came afterwards to reſtore them to him, and inſtantly did requeſt him to tell him out of what Authors thoſe pieces did proceed. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That the ſheets came from an Author, who was the firſt man that had taught the world Eloquence; but he would ſhortly make it appear that he was not the only Wonder. Say you ſo, replyed <hi>Francion,</hi> I do believe I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand your deſign: I do remember when I was in the College with you, you did indevour ſo much to imitate <hi>Maleherb,</hi> and
<hi>Coiffeteau,</hi> (as <hi>Raymond</hi> may perceive by your Diſcourſe, of which I have given him an account) that on my faith it did render you ridiculous; you would do the ſame again with this new Author upon all occaſions, as you make it apparent by all the Diſcourſes which you have had with us. But take heed how you imitate any Author in that which is defective or impertinent. To imitate ſuch, is to imitate a man who is alwayes coughing, or breaking wind backwards. I remember, that when I was at
<hi>Paris,</hi> I had a Lackey who was extremely enamour'd on a Maid-ſervant in the next houſe. Having found in my Study the Loves of <hi>Nerveza</hi> and
<hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcuteaux,</hi> which I kept to make me laugh, he did tear out all the leaves where the Complements were, and learned them by heart, to repeat them to his Miſtreſſe, and carried them alwayes in his pocket to ſtudy on them, for fear he ſhould forget them. I believe that you tread in the ſame path as he hath done, my dear Maſter.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoken thoſe words, he began to uſe ſuch Mimick geſtures about <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> and obſerving that he looked ſtedfaſtly on the ground, without turning to any ſide, and that his hat did hang down over his eyes, he plucked off his Hat to ſee what he had within it, and found in the bottom of the crown a Book of ſome bulk, in which he had written, <hi>A Salute at the firſt Entrance, The Serious Entertainment, The Jovial Interlocution, and The Farewell, or Complement at the Departure.</hi> And in the purfute of theſe Titles, he had in the end of every one of them elegant Phraſes, which were all new. What? ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> Are theſe the things which you have to ſhew unto us? You may be e'en jogging now, we ſhall be all of us well ſatisfied by that time as we ſhall have read them over.</p>
            <p>The ill adventure of <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> accompanied with thoſe ſcoffs, did ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe him, that he had gone away, were it not, that having loſt his Book, he had forgotten his Complement of Departure.
<hi>Francion</hi> being unwilling to provoke him any further, did ſay unto him with a moſt pleaſant ſweetneſſe of voice, You obſerve, Sir, that as the natural whiteneſſe of the complexion, is more agreeable by farre, than that which doth proceed from Painting, ſo the proper Subjects we diſcourſe on, and which we invent of our ſelves, are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than thoſe which we take out of Common places. I ſhould more extoll the language of the College, than that which you affect. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, that he knew not what anſwer to return, and <hi>Francion</hi> changing the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59287:143"/>Subject of his Diſcourſe, did intreat him to leave with him what he had of the works his new Author. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> did readily conſent unto it, and to put him again in a good humour, they did ſpeak no more of what was paſſed, but did fall on praiſing the incomparable Inventions of his fabulous Hiſtories, ſo that he departed well-contented with his Diſciple.</p>
            <p>After his departure, <hi>Francion</hi> did turn over the leaves which he had lent him, and perceived they were Letters addreſſed to ſeveral perſons. His judgement thereon was, there was many good things in the Author, and to balance that, there were alſo as many bad, ſo that if ſome of them deſerve crowns, others did merit the laſh; Beſides, he deſcryed, that what was good in them was all ſtolen out of antient books, and that which was impertinent did proceed from the Author himſelf: Nevertheleſſe, it might well be that the ignorant might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them well enough, they being the only men that did eſteem them, who took no heed to diſcover the thefts, becauſe they never did read any good book. There was nothing within them to obſerve, but certain fancies, which had much of the Air of thoſe of <hi>Turlupin,</hi> and were untowardly mingled among things of Gravity and State. The Author did write unto Cardinals, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grave perſonages, as if he had been ſpeaking to ſome voluptuous people, who had taken delight to hear their vanities repeated and reputed. <hi>Francion</hi> obſerved alſo ſome other particularities, at which he laughed with
<hi>Raymond,</hi> both of them wondring at the high eſtimation which was given to ſuch works, and how that he who made them could have that preſumption which he teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his writings; Another book ought to be made in that, to mark the faults of it all over. But let us leave theſe follies of the time, and let them be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by thoſe who have a mind unto it, it is of no conſequence at all, ſince there is no man doth conſtrain us to extoll them. I do believe it will never be, for Kings have ſomething elſe to doe than to make Edicts to that effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion</hi> being retired from reading that book, the extravagancies whereof did afford him much pleaſure, he did bring it back himſelf to <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing to him of it either good or bad. He had no more a deſire to make himſelf merry at any ſubject which arrived, Love did too much proſecute him, and he did goe to wait upon
<hi>Nays,</hi> who, were he alone, or were he accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, did content her ſelf to teſtifie the courteſie to him, and would not have it to proceed as far as love.</p>
            <p>He at that time had received money in <hi>Rome</hi> from the hands of a Money-Merchant, ſo that he increaſed his train, and began to be wonderfully gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant. He lived at a great rate with <hi>Raymond,</hi> who called him brother, ſo that one of them was every where eſteemed for a Count, as indeed he was, and the other for a Marqueſſe. He oftentimes gave viſitation to his Miſtreſſe, and in the cloſe of the Evening would always ſing after the Muſicians, to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his love more apparent. What Lady could not be overcome by his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? He had a good garb, He did ſing well, He did play on many Inſtruments of Muſick, He was of a ſweet diſpoſition, and of the moſt complacent in the world; a Gentleman of a great knowledge, and who diſcourſed excellently well, and did write far better, and not on one ſubject only, but on all; He compoſed both in Verſe and in Proſe, and was admirable in both. When he diſcourſed on a ſerious ſubject there proceeded nothing but wonders from him, and when he would exerciſe his fancy in a Satyrick mirth, he would have made the ſevereſt Stoick to laugh outright. There are many to be ſeen who have ſome one of theſe perfections, but how rare are they who have them all, and eſpecially in ſo eminent a degree as he was maſter of them? He was the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of all the diſcourſe at <hi>Rome.</hi> There was not any one who durſt openly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be his Rival, and thoſe who did know that he had ſetled his affections on <hi>Nays,</hi> did eſteem her to be moſt happy in ſo accompliſhed a Servant; <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59287:144"/>Moreover, he was found to be of honourable parentage, and to have in <hi>France</hi> ſuch large poſſeſſions, that he deſerved to have her for his Wife. She had a good and a great opinion of him, but her fear was that he would not eſpouſe an Italian, and that having paſſed away ſome time in courting her, he would return into his own Country. She communicated this her fear to
<hi>Dorini,</hi> who did diſcover it to <hi>Raymond,</hi> and both of them did go to <hi>Francion</hi> to acquaint him with it. Brother, you ſee, ſaid
<hi>Raymond,</hi> It is now time to conclude, and to be no longer paſſionate for <hi>Nays;</hi> you profeſſe that you love her above all things, Conſider, if you can reſolve with your ſelf to paſſe away your life with her; She is fair and rich, and which is more, ſhe loveth you; Delay her no longer, if you will not marry her, and intend to leave her, you do but hinder ſome one elſe, who would be a ſervant to her; you will gain nothing by her but by marriage, ſhe is too wiſe to part with her honour; If you love her ſo entirely as you profeſſe, take her to your Wife.
<hi>Francion</hi> embracing him did reply, My dear Brother, If I conceived my ſelf to be worthy of that which you propound unto me, I ſhould arrive to the height of all my joys. <hi>Dorini</hi> interrupting him, did promiſe that he had ſpoken as much for him as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and he believed that his Coſin would not diſdain him. He failed not the ſame day to purſue his accuſtomed ſollicitations, and in the proſecution of it,
<hi>Francion</hi> himſelf in the Afternoon did make his addreſſes to her, where ſo fully he declared his ſervice, that they both made a promiſe to love one another eternally, and to accompliſh their marriage as ſoon as their affairs could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion</hi> the next morning diſpatched a Poſt with Letters to his Mother, to adviſe her of his good fortune, &amp; entertaining no more any care that might feed upon his ſpirit, his only imployment was to paſſe away his time in delight, and to make his Miſtreſſe to be partaker of it. He would every morning breath himſelf, and his Horſe, in running at the Ring; After Dinner he often danced in Masks, and made ſumptuous Feaſts, and in every thing he did ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo magnificent, that he charmed the hearts of all the Italians. The gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Spirits of <hi>Rome</hi> made it their ambition to be acquainted with him. There were no Verſes compoſed but in the praiſes only of him, and of his Miſtreſſe, but they were not comparable to thoſe which he did make himſelf. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> made Verſes alſo, and did infinitely extoll him. Amongſt other things he made Achroſticks, and Anagrams, as being moſt proper to his Pedantick Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. He made alſo other Verſes, where in many places he did equivocate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Name, and the letters of it. He informed him that his name was <hi>Francion</hi> becauſe he was ſo Frank and free, and becauſe he was the braveſt man among all the French, and that if any one ſhould undertake to write his Hiſtory, he muſt call it
<hi>Franciade,</hi> and that it would be in as great eſteem as that of
<hi>Ronſard,</hi> and if <hi>Francion</hi> the Son of <hi>Hector</hi> was the common Father of the <hi>French,</hi> this <hi>Francion</hi> of our Age muſt be the Protector of the <hi>French,</hi> and capable to furniſh them with moſt excellent Counſell. <hi>Francion</hi> demanded of him if he would do him the honour as to digeſt his Adventures into order, and make them memorable to Poſterity, but <hi>Hortenſius</hi> made anſwer, that he did leave that charge to himſelf, and that there was not any one who more lively than himſelf could repreſent thoſe fortunes to which himſelf arrived. Some few days afterwards being alone with <hi>Raymond,</hi> he recited to him the anſwer of <hi>Hortenſius, Raymond</hi> did very well approve of it, and demanded of him if he would not one day take the pains to compile his own Hiſtory, which was ſo worthy to be known, and if he had not a deſire to ſee in publick under his own name ſo many brave works which he had compoſed. He replyed, I have not wrote ſo much as you believe, and ſome things may be ſhewen to you, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from me, which are but meer Impoſtures. Beſides, what pleaſure ſhall I receive to ſee a Book printed in my Name, ſeeing there are abroad ſo <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59287:144"/>many Ignorant and ridiculous Pamphlets which every day do diſgrace the Preſſe. I leave it to you to judge, ſince <hi>Hortenſius</hi> and his Uſher are of the ſame Trade, that the people that ſhall hear of them, looking on other Books, wil believe that they do proceed from perſons of the ſame Complexion. All which I have done as yet, hath been as privat as hath been poſſible for me to do, and to ſolace my ſelf when I was conſtrained to be a Shepherd, I made a Book, which I believe will be paſſable enough, but it is not my deſire that every one ſhould ſee it. I can now be too hard for you, ſaid <hi>Raymond,</hi> I have the Key of the Cabanet where all your papers are, which I will not reſtore unto you, till I have peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that Piece. You will have much to do to find it, replyed <hi>Francion,</hi> for it is in a ſure place; for know, it is not written, but in my Memory, only but allow me ſome Pen-men, and in eight dayes I will dictate the whole work intirely to them. Your Memory, ſaid <hi>Raymond,</hi> is admirable, and your Judgement is no leſſe. But tell me, By what Name do you call thoſe Books which you have compoſed? <hi>Francion</hi> made anſwer, There is one Book of Love, which I have dedicated, or had rather a deſire to dedicate, to
<hi>Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lemon,</hi> I have heretofore made mention of it to you, and ſince that time I have wrote another Book of Field Recreations, with ſome Playes and Comedies, and other Inventions. There is alſo another Book in which I have pleaſantly deſcribed ſome of my adventures, which I call <hi>The Errors of Youth.</hi> If any one ſhall impoſe any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Book upon me, I ſhall diſavow it. It is true, that not long ſince a Friend told me, You have compoſed ſeveral Books, for you have made this, and that, and another Book, and named a number of Books. On my Faith (ſaid I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him) you have not yet the perfect number of them; If you will be exact, to mark all that is done amiſs, I will ſhew you ſome pieces which I did write at eighteen years of age, and will you put thoſe alſo into the number of my Books? That Anſwer ſtopped his mouth; and I muſt aſſure you, if you will oblige me to you, you muſt forget thoſe petty follies of my Youth, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach me with them. I was then but of a tender age, and therefore I ought to be excuſed. Would you believe, that even that Book made in my Nonage, hath found ſome to commend it? Not long ſince I did go to give a viſit to one of my Friends, whom I had the happineſſe to find in his Chamber. There was a Gentleman who was well acquainted with us both, and one of his Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who did not know me; who falling into Diſcourſe of that Book, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demanded of him, If there were not good things in it? He made anſwer, They were very rare things. I asked of him, what he found well in it? &amp; talked a long time of it, as of an indifferent thing. He did the like, and freely told me, That, in his opinion the Author did too much amuſe himſelf in Scholaſtick me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations. I coldly replyed to him, and without altering my Countenance, That it was that which pleaſed me, and which, I believed, would pleaſe alſo all Ingenious people, ſince there are no Men of Quality who have not had their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation in the Vniverſity. He was ſurprized with amazement to find that I was the Author of the Book which he undervalued; and afterwards, to cover his fault, he told me, that he did like it very well himſelf. I proteſt unto you, (ſaid
<hi>Raymond</hi> then to <hi>Francion</hi>) This is one of the moſt generous actions that I have ever heard of; and moreover this ingenious way to diſcover your ſelf was truly excellent. A Fool would have leaped into a Rage, and called all the World to witneſs; but for you, there is nothing here to be found, that could trouble the tranquility of your Soul. You acquaint me with ſome Apothegms, which are worth all thoſe that are recorded to have been ſpoken by illuſtrious perſonages, and although I do remember that you call them, The Eſſays of your Youth, yet they may be read with ſingular delight, ſince we take pleaſure to hear the Adventures of Beggers and Thieves, and Shepherds. It is moſt true, ſaid
<hi>Francion,</hi> and I aſſure you, that although there are ſome who affirm there are things in that Book which are not worthy to be recorded,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59287:145"/>yet, before they judge of them, it is requiſit that the Readers ſhould through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand them; I know as well as they what ought to be inſerted, and what to be omitted, but I was pleaſed to write of ſome things that concerned my ſelf, which being true, do need no other Ornaments, than their own live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. For all that I will not debaſe my ſelf, and I will not be aſhamed to ſay, that I know not if thoſe Writers (which at this day are ſo glorious, being ſo young as I was when I compoſed that Book of which I ſpeak unto you, being (as I have ſaid) but of eighteen years of age) would have given ſuch demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of their underſtanding. I will not travel farr for any Example, I ſhould be glad if theſe makers of Romances by the dozen, and thoſe who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly do compoſe Letters to have them printed, could perform any thing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in ſo ſhort a time, and with ſuch little Study as I did take in that Book. I compoſed in one day no leſſe than two and thirty pages for the Preſſe, and it was moreover with a Spirit inceſſantly perplexed with other thoughts, and I could not intirely addict my ſelf unto it. Sometimes I was heavy, and half a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, and knew no other motion, but that only of my right hand; ſo that if I did write at that time any thing which was good, it was only by Fortune. Moreover, it was a pain unto me to take the pains to read over my own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and to correct them; for by what Incouragement ſhould I perſiſt on this Sloth of Study? I ſhould gain no glory at all if I had made a good Book, and ſhould I have received it, it was too vain by farr to have charmed me: It is eaſie therefore to collect by this neglect, (which according to the ſincerity of my Conſcience I do acknowledge) that thoſe works (in which I have exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the faculties of my Spirit) will be of another price; but it is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that I can ſo intirely addict my ſelf to any particulars, for I do much hate thoſe unprofitable obſervations to which our Writers do devote themſelves. It was never my Intention to follow them, and being, as I am, altogether of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother temper, I ought not to be put in the ſame rank with them, unleſſe they will give me a quality which I am not in a capacity to receive. They inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trouble their Imaginations, to furniſh them with ſome new ſubjects to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the deſire they have to write, which goeth before the conſideration of their ability, and I write not, but only to put into order thoſe Conceptions which a long time I have entertained. If any one ſhall think that in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I do defie them, I will not take the pains to remove that opinion from him; for I am confident, that in making profeſſion religiouſly to obſerve the rules of a Gentleman, or Nobility, I may challenge my adverſaries, if I pleaſe my ſelf, as well to the combat of the Pen, as of the Sword. I ſhall not teſtify a greater vanity in one than in the other, in promiſing my ſelf the Victory. Nevertheleſſe I will not vex my ſelf at ſo poor a thing, and having alwayes made a greater account of actions than of words, I had rather exerciſe my ſelf in Virtue, than in Eloquence; and thoſe ſhall deceive themſelves, who obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that which above I have mentioned, ſhall conclude me to be arrogant: They will object unto me, that to praiſe my own Works, is to follow the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Mountebanks at New-bridge, who extoll their Balſoms, and of the Comedians, who in their papers which they ſtick up in every Corner of the ſtreet, doe give their Plays the titles of admirable, and incomparable; But it is to be conſidered, that if any one deſerveth to be blamed for that, they are thoſe only who having endeavoured to perſwade us that they have made a good Book, would perſwade us withall, that their perſons are indued with excellent qualities; not weighing with themſelves, that even looſe and lewd Men do ſometimes accompliſh a good Piece. Let the World then take notice, that I take things at another turn of the Scale than theſe Men do, and being atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with more Innocence than Vanity, I cannot but with ſome reluctation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That if I confeſſe I write well, it is becauſe I find it to be ſo poor a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that it is no great glory to become Maſter of it, if I find not my ſelf <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59287:145"/>withall to be Maſter of other perfections with it. What is it for a Man to boaſt that he hath overcome, and ſurmounted all Misfortunes, and that he knoweth how to govern Nations, but only to demonſtrate that he is the Maſter of an inſolent Spirit? If there are any who will not be contented with this reaſon, and will take diſtaſt at what I have ſaid, I do let him alone to believe what he pleaſeth, and that my Book being petulant all over, all may be taken for raile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which I have ſpoken. That which maketh moſt for me, and which clearly ſheweth, that I do not mind the reputation of a great Writer, is, That having not put my Name unto my Book, the glory which I do give my ſelf can convey unto me no profit at all. I am a meer ſtranger to this Impertinence, againſt which an Antient Writer hath ſo much cryed out, who having made a Book, upbraiding the vanity of thoſe, who by their Writings would purchaſe renown unto themſelves, did not forbear from naming himſelf the Author of it. I have not been ſo vain as to commit the like fault, after I have ſo much miſprized that glory. I am not ignorant of the ſubtilty of
<hi>Phydias,</hi> who being forbidden to write his Name at the foot of the Statue of <hi>Minerva</hi> which he had made, did draw his own Pourtraict in a little corner of the Buckler of the ſaid Goddeſſe, that there it might be alwayes ſeen, but if I ſhould find room to ſet forth my ſelf in ſome part of my Book, wher it might be diſcovered who I am, I do believe that I ſhould not do it; At the leaſt, I am moſt confident that I ſhould never ſuffer to have my name printed in the Frontiſpiece, or firſt Leaf of the Book, much leſſe to have it paſted on the Walls of the City: for it is not my humor to take pride, that on every Sunday my Name ſhould afflict the Doors of the Churches, and the Pillars in the corners of the Streets; Nor ſhould I glory to have it ſeen amongſt the Titles of the Comedians, or to ſee it on the Walls, keeping Company with thoſe who profeſſe they cure the Pox, and broken Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. I doubt not but many, ſeeing my reſolution to conceal my ſelf, will have as great a reſolution themſelves to enquire after me, and will importunately deſire the Bookſellers to acquaint them who I am; I will therefore ſend them back with that brisk anſwer of the
<hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> who being demanded by a Friend whom he did meet with, what he carried under his Cloak, replyed to him, The queſtion which you propound unto me, is in vain; for, if I had a Deſire that you ſhould know what it is, I would not cover it. With the ſame mony I muſt pay thoſe, who have too much Curioſity concerning this Book, and I am content that they ſhould take it to be as ſome Infant
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound in the Streets, who hath either made up himſelf, or who hath no Father that can be found to take care for him. Do the Readers believe that I am obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with my Name, when I can never learn their Names, and when an infinite number of Men, who are never to be of my Acquaintance, ſhall read it in my Book? If there be any to whom I ſhall be obliged to diſcover my Name, it ſhall be to my intimate Friends, who will take my pains in good part; when thoſe who do not know it, will, peradventure blame me, finding that I did addict my ſelf to ſuch petulant and idle Subjects, when I had ſo many ſerious Thoughts to deliver.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Francion</hi> was ſpeaking this, <hi>Raymond</hi> was very attentive to him, and ſaid unto him, I muſt confeſſe that you have the moſt noble, and the moſt generous apprehenſions in the world. I ſhould be never a weary to liſten to you. You exquiſitely do expreſſe your ſelf on a variety of Subjects, which do all deſerve to be recorded; and it ſeems to me, that the Readers of your books ſhould be glad to find there the like advertiſements which you now declare. You do too much oblige me (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) but I dare aſſure you, That it is moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary oftentimes to make an Advertiſement, or a Preface to the Reader; for many particulars are there oftentimes contained, which conduce unto the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of our Underſtanding; nevertheleſſe moſt men are ſo careleſſe, that they ſeldom, or never, read the Preface, not knowing, That oftentimes <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59287:146"/>there is more there than in all the reſt of the Book, and the Author there makes manifeſt with what ſpirit he is endued. One day I demanded of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of that humour, wherefore he did not read the Prefaces. He made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, becauſe he believed they were all of one making, and having read one of them in his life, he conceived it was enough; he conjectured alſo that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and the Title reſembled one another. But let not thoſe do ſo, who ſhall have my Books within their hands, if they will oblige me to have any eſteem of them. Let them be carefull to read all my Prefaces; for I am moſt elabou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in them, and inſert not any thing which is not uſefull. I will be none of thoſe Readers (ſaid <hi>Raymond</hi>) that ſhall fail in that particular; But tell me, I pray you, what is the Book which you compoſed laſt? It is a pleaſant Hiſtory (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) It is already made, and yet not one word written of it; It is a ſharp and a pointed Satyre on the minds and manners of ſome men, of whom I aſſume the liberty to ſpeak moſt freely; and becauſe the ſtile is not ordinary, and I cannot give ſuch a Title to the Book as is able to expreſſe what it doth contain, I will call it <hi>The Book without a Title.</hi> That ſhall be the Title of the Book, and if that ſhall not be the Title of it, howſoever it will agree well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with ſuch a fantaſtical piece. The Subject on which I will expreſſe my ſelf, ſhall be to decipher the life and the vices of many perſons of quality, who p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etend to be grave and ſerious, and have nothing but Hypocriſie in their hearts. And as the Book doth bear a Title, and yet is without a Title, ſo I h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve thought upon another thing which is very agreeable to it, It is, to inſert an Epiſtle Dedicatory, which ſhall be no Epiſtle Dedicatory, or at leaſt to dedicate it, without having of it dedicated at all. This is my Invention, you ſhall find theſe words printed in the beginning of the ſecond leaf, in great Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>TO THE GRANDIES,</hi> as if it were the addreſſe of a Dedicatory, and under it ſhall follow this Epiſtle.</p>
            <p>It is not to dedicate this Book to you that I make this Epiſtle; but it is, that you may underſtand that I do not dedicate it unto you. You will, peradventure, object, It is no ſuch great Preſent, and but a Packet only of idle and fooliſh actions, which I have as idly obſerved, and collected, but you will ſay, Why do you not give unto us an account of virtuous Deeds? Why ſhall I not have the liberty to ſpeak of thoſe things which great men dare do? I have too free a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to conceal the Truth, and if I had the leiſure, I had inlarged this Volume with the lives of infinite perſons, who do ſeem to challenge place in my Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by their continual enormities. But if thoſe, of whom in my Satyrical enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments I have already made mention, doe not conſider that I appear firſt of all in the rank, and are not contented to ſpeak unto me, becauſe I have ſpoke of them, Do you know what they will gain to find themſelves offended? Tis this, They will diſcover to all the world, that it is of them whom I do ſpeak, which was not known before; and moreover, they will procure, that for the time to come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſhall not feign to name them, becauſe they have begun to do it themſelves. Do you conceive that a man of ſuch a temper doth perplex him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about the Dedication of Books? and that I who can adore no perfections but what are divine, ought to humble my ſelf before multitudes who are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to give thanks to Fortune, that ſhe hath granted them riches to cover their defects? You are to underſtand, that I look not on the world but as a Comedy, and eſteem of men no more, but only as they do act well the part which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them. He who is a Peaſant, and liveth according to the Rules of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty in that condition, doth ſeem to me more commendable, than he who is born a Gentleman, and performeth not the actions of a Gentleman. So that prizing every one according as he is, and not according to that which he hath, I do equally eſteem thoſe who have the charge of the greateſt affairs, with thoſe who have only but a charge of raggs upon their baggs, if Virtue doth not make the difference. Nevertheleſſe, I have not ſo little a conſideration to the <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59287:146"/>truth, but that I do believe there may be found a Generation as illuſtrious for their Merit, as their Birth and Fortunes, and that this age is not ſo barbarous, but that there are ſome of you who love honourable actions, let but thoſe who are of the number cauſe themſelves to be known better than heretofore, and I promiſe them that then I will not only dedicate Books unto them, but ſhall be ready to live and dye in their ſervice.</p>
            <p>This is the Epiſtle which <hi>I</hi> have addreſſed to the Grandies, which is for all that not an Epiſtle, or at leaſt is not dedicative, but it is rather a negative E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle. <hi>Raymond</hi> replyed, It is bold, and gallant, and no man can be offended at it, for it is not to men of Virtue to whom you ſpeak, they are exempted, but when will it be that in earneſt you will ſet your ſelf in work about it? I hope (ſaid
<hi>Francion</hi>) that within a few days I ſhall put Pen to Paper, to write my laſt work, but I will not publiſh it no more than I will the entire Hiſtory in which I will labour when I ſhall attain unto the Haven whereof I do deſire to arrive. For my ſelf, I do not affect to torment my ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rits, I doe not write but only to divert my ſelf, and before I do take my Pen into my hand, I do take my Lute from the Caſe, and after I have wrote a leaf, I do walk, and play, which is to me as the reſpite of Muſick betwixt the acts of a Comedy. Obſerve what are the pains which I take, I bite not my Nails in meditation of what I am to write; Would it be fit, do you think, to make poſterity partake in things no better ſtudied? I ſhould have repented to have been elaborate, for I deſire that none but my familiar Friends may peruſe thoſe works which I ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. It will be ſome comfort to me (ſaid <hi>Raymond</hi>) that I am one of that number, and alſo I do perſwade my ſelf that, your Hiſtory being finiſhed, you will not forget me. My brave friend (ſaid
<hi>Francion</hi>) upon my faith you ſpeak too ſeriouſly concerning that which is nothing worth; I will not leave you in this error; you muſt underſtand I am no ſuch great Scholar, as, ſince our firſt acquaintance in <hi>France,</hi> I have made you, for pleaſure to believe. There is more of me in apparence than in effect; I have by heart ſome pieces of my friends, of which I debate oftentimes with my ſelf, and when I have preſented any thing to perſonages of Honour, I in the like manner do aſſiſt my ſelf with the labours of other men, or do add ſomething to it of my ſelf which is of no value. How can it be, that ſo poor a Cavallier as my ſelf ſhould have learned ſo much? It is for thoſe to be learned who are Gentlemen of that profeſſion, and have ſlept upon <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> Hill. See here a pleaſing Diſſimulation, Do you think (ſaid <hi>Raymond</hi>) to excuſe your ſelf from ſhewing me your works? Becauſe you will have it ſo (replyed <hi>Francion</hi>) I will ſhew unto you all that which I have compoſed, although it be not worthy of your eye. It was well known that
<hi>Francion</hi> had not ſo narrow a capacity; In a ſhort time he was able to accompliſh whatſoever he undertook, but it was true, that this was the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in which he had rather give a Subiect to others to write upon, than to write himſelf. He was now buſie on other thoughts, and ſeeing that <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> who was always the ſame man, was indued with an incomparable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, he determined to put ſome pleaſant deſign in practice to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf merry with him. He communicated this deſign to
<hi>Raymond, Du Buiſſon,</hi> and <hi>Audebert,</hi> without whom he could do nothing at all, and the more to advance the plot, he made partakers of it four <hi>Alman</hi> Gentlemen, with whom he was acquainted, Men of a gallant Converſation, and whom <hi>Hortenſius</hi> as yet had never ſeen. One day as he was with him, <hi>Audebert</hi> entred into the Chamber, and ſaid? There are lately ſome <hi>Polonians</hi> come to <hi>Rome,</hi> Know you not what buſineſſe they have to do? It is ſaid that their King is dead, but I have not yet heard who is he whom they have choſen to ſucceed him, It muſt be ſome Prince of <hi>Italy</hi> who is now in this City.</p>
            <p>All who were preſent ſaid, it was the firſt news they had heard of it, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing with themſelves who ſhould be King of
<hi>Polonia,</hi> One named one <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59287:147"/>Prince, and another another. This paſſed in this manner, and <hi>Du Buiſſon</hi> departed from them on purpoſe to walk up and down the City; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning afterwards to <hi>Raymond,</hi> as <hi>Francion, Dorini,</hi> and <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> whom he had left with them, were ſitting down to Supper, he did ſpeak with a ſerious Countenance, Hardly, on my faith, will you believe that which I have learned abroad; it is true, there are <hi>Polonians</hi> in this City, who are come to find out him whom they have choſen for their King. I have enquired who it is; It was repreſented to me that they have elected a
<hi>French</hi> Gentleman, who, being indued with ſingular Learning, will eſtabliſh Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice amongſt them in her primitive ſplendor, and by his good Counſell will make them ſucceſſefull in their Warrs. I did ſpeak to one Man, who told me, that he who is to be their King, is called
<hi>Hortenſius,</hi> and that the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> did much rejoyce to have a King, who in a direct line procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from an antient Conſul of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and turning to <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, Sir, It muſt needs be you. But is that true which you ſpeak ſaid
<hi>Hortenſius? Buiſſon</hi> replyed, Let me not live if it be not ſo; You ſpeedily will find ſufficient aſſurances of it. Thereupon every one did begin to ſpeak ſeriouſly of it, rejoycing at ſo good a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, inſomuch that <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was quite beſides himſelf.</p>
            <p>They had not half ſupped, but a Caroach and ſome Horſes were heard to arrive at the Gate of the Houſe, and there was one who twice or thrice knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at the Door; <hi>Petronius,</hi> a Gentleman who belonged to
<hi>Francion,</hi> was ſent down to underſtand who it was. He brought word they were <hi>Polonians,</hi> who ſaid they would ſpeak with a Signior named <hi>Hortenſius.</hi> It is you (ſaid <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi>) they would ſpeak with; there is no doubt to be made of it. Good God! Why did we Sup ſo late? How rudely doth this Chamber ſhow? They will find all things out of order. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> had then a glaſſe of Wine in his hand, which he was conveying to his mouth; but as the Proverb doth affirm, That many things do happen betwixt the cup and the mouth, this News did ſo raviſh him with an exilience of joy, that his hand failed, and both glaſſe and Wine did fall down together; It is ſpilt and broken, but it is no great matter, ſaid tranſported <hi>Hortenſius;</hi> But what a Fool was I to put on ſuch diſgracefull Cloaths, this day? What will the Ambaſſadors ſay, to ſee me ſo ill appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? I would that I had been advertiſed of their comming but a little ſooner, I would have taken care to have accommodated my ſelf better, and <hi>Raymond</hi> would have lent me his richeſt Cloak. You muſt be ſomething (ſaid <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>) in the faſhion of their Country, I will tell you what you ſhall do; whereupon they all riſing from the Table, the Groom did take away, and put all things in <hi>Raymonds</hi> Chamber in as good order as poſſibly he could. <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> ſent into his Wardrobe for a ſhort Coat lined with Furr, the out-ſide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Roſe-colour Sattin, which he was accuſtomed to wear when he was not well. He ſaid unto
<hi>Hortenſius,</hi> Throw that upon your ſhoulders. The
<hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> will give you the more reſpect, ſeeing that you are already habited ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the faſhion of their Country; for there they make uſe of Furrs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, becauſe it is more cold in their Country than in this. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was poſſeſſed with ſo extreme a Joy, that he believed all manner of Counſels. He put on the Coat very readily, and being ſet in a high Chair, according to the advice of
<hi>Francion,</hi> they did all ſtand bare-headed on both ſides of him, to give an opinion to the <hi>Polonians</hi> that he was ſome grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or.
<hi>Raymond</hi> whiſpered him in the ear, Be ſure you have your
<hi>Latin</hi> Tongue in a readineſſe, for, no doubt, their Oration will be in that Language, it is as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with them as their Mother Tongue; and I aſſure my ſelf, that one of the reaſons for which they elected you to be their King, is, becauſe they are adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized you are an extraordinary
<hi>Latin</hi> Scholar.</p>
            <p>As he ſpake thoſe words, the four <hi>Almans,</hi> who were apparelled according <pb n="16" facs="tcp:59287:147"/>to the <hi>Polonian</hi> faſhion, did enter into the Chamber with ſix Torches burning before them. The moſt apparent of the Troup, who repreſented the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, did make a profound reverence to <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> and thoſe who attended on him, afterwards he made this Speech, having firſt methodically coughed, and ſtroaked and wiped both his Muſtachioes one after the other.</p>

Amongſt other things, he declared, That the Reaſon which moſt particularly moved the <hi>Polonians</hi> to elect <hi>Hortenſius</hi> for their King, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the renown which he had gained by his Writings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which were ſpred through all Countries) was, That he was the Man of whom the ancient Sages of that Country were believed to ſpeak in their Prophecies of a learned King which ſhould make <hi>Polonia</hi> the happieſt Country on the Earth. When the Orator had ended,

The <hi>Polonians</hi> made unto him many humble Reverences, and taking their leaves of him, did uſe ſuch ſtrange geſtures, as if they had been raviſhed with admiration. One of them could not forbear from ſaying, <hi>O miraculum Mundi! O Rex Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, qualis Pactolus ex ore tuo emanet?</hi> Another cried out, <hi>O alter Amphion! quot urbes ſonus tuae vocis aedificaturus eſt?</hi> And ſo they departed, accumulating him with all praiſes, and Preſages, as the future glory of <hi>Polonia,</hi> and <hi>Franci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> did conduct them down with an extreme joy, to ſee them act their parts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the life.</p>
            <p>Upon his return, <hi>Buiſſon</hi> being newly come out of his extaſie, in which he feigned himſelf to be, did caſt himſelf down before the knees of <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> and ſaid unto him with a voice weak and faint, Great Prince, Have a care of your faithfull Servant, now your Virtues have added one ſpoke more to the wheel of your Fortune; Make me your Creature, and give me ſome place in which I may live with Honour.
<hi>Francion</hi> plucking him from him, reproved him for his impudence, ſo ſuddenly to importune the King, and ſaid unto him, Cannot you have the patience to attend until he be arrived to his Dominions? If <hi>Du Buiſſon</hi> do not deport himſelf more wiſely (ſaid
<hi>Hortenſius</hi>) I ſhall tell him, That he deſerveth to be rejected when he demandeth any thing; and that <hi>Francion</hi> deſerveth to have any thing granted to him when he demandeth it not.</p>
            <p>As this paſſed, there did ariſe a queſtion, whether
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> ſhould ſtay where he was, or return to his ordinary Lodging? <hi>Raymond</hi> was of opinion that he ſhould not go, becauſe the place was too little, and that it were expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient be ſhould ſtay there, where he ſhould be as Maſter of them all; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that all the
<hi>French</hi> Nation would think themſelves honoured by the Kingdom of
<hi>Polonia,</hi> who had made choice of him, there was ſcarce a
<hi>French</hi> man in <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſaid, but would come to attend upon his perſon, as if they were his followers, and do him honour before the
<hi>Polonians. Raymond</hi> having ſpoken theſe words, did reſign the poſſeſſion of his Chamber to him, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him a Groom to help him off with his cloaths, he retired into another room with the reſt of the Company.</p>
            <p>They were no ſooner departed, but <hi>Hortenſius</hi> called for <hi>Audebert,</hi> being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <pb n="17" facs="tcp:59287:148"/>ready deſirous to uſe the authority of a King: when he was come, he told him that he muſt ſit up the greateſt part of that night by his Bedſide, becauſe the cares which did poſſeſſe him did hinder him from ſleeping.
<hi>Audebert</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad of it, for being of a pregnant underſtanding, he hoped, by his long waking, and extravagant diſcourſes,
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> would become a Fool, and that ſo they ſhould receive the more pleaſure from him. <hi>Audebert</hi> my friend (ſaid
<hi>Hortenſius</hi>) Didſt not thou remember that the <hi>Polonians</hi> ſaid, rhat they had Prophecies concerning me, they are not deceived in it; If we ſhall but conſult with the <hi>Ephemerides,</hi> we ſhall diſcover very rare conſequences; Didſt not thou read when we were at <hi>Paris</hi> the Almanack of <hi>Iohn Petit</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> and that of
<hi>Larivay</hi> the young <hi>Troyen,</hi> I am perſwaded that they did prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of my adventures. One of them ſaith, that on this time there ſhall be a change of the affairs towards the North, and that the humble ſhall be exalted. Is it not a great change, when they come ſo far to look for a King? and have I not always walked humbly before God? It is to be imagined that you have (ſaid <hi>Audebert</hi>) I would that we had the Oracles of the Sibylls, the Book of Abbot <hi>Ioachim,</hi> the Revelation of Saint <hi>Bridget,</hi> the Prophecies of <hi>Merlin,</hi> or the Centuries of
<hi>Noſtradamus,</hi> we ſhould there, no doubt, find ſomething which hath been ſpoken of you, and to tell you the truth, all thoſe books are very gentile, and very uſefull; Things are not to be marked there, but when they are come to paſſe; But whether they have made mention or not of your Royalty, what need you to care, ſince it is arrived to you? O (replyed
<hi>Hortenſius</hi>) It would be of great uſe unto me, for I may poſſibly find that alſo which may befall me all the remainder of my life, and by that means I may withdraw my ſelf from the dangers which do threaten me. Wherefore, if you will gain my favour, make it now appear unto me by your expedition, and ſeek out for me the Revelations of Saint <hi>Bridget,</hi> our Hoſt hath ſome part of them. <hi>Audebert,</hi> who to pleaſe himſelf did indeavour to pleaſe him, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for the Book, and at laſt obtained it, <hi>Hortenſius</hi> cauſed him to read the Prophecies, to which he liſtned with great attention, and when he heard any thing which ſeemed to ſquare with his own adventures, he did read it himſelf nine or ten times over, and did m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>k the Page with his Nail, and having made extravagant explications thereon, he did dictate them to <hi>Audebert,</hi> who did wrire them down for him. In this manner they paſſed away the greateſt part of that night, and at the laſt their heads nodding to one another, as if they would both fall from their ſhoulders on the Book, they reſolved to give ſome hours of Indulgence to ſleep and reſt. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> being in bed, did ſpeak to <hi>Audebert</hi> to come to Bed to him, but he was very ceremonious, and alleged that it was too much honour for him to lie with a Prince, and therefore he would not commit ſo great an overſight, but
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> aſſured him that he ſhould lie with him for once, and that he would not permit him to refuſe that happineſſe, ſo long as the Scepter was not yet in his hand. <hi>Audebert</hi> in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his command, coming into the Bed to him, they both of them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately did fall aſleep, and ſo ſoundly, as if they had laid a wager which of them ſhould have their ſenſes moſt beclowded. As for the Groom of the Chamber, he did go to bed long before, being weary of waiting on ſuch a Maſter.</p>
            <p>The next morning <hi>Audebert</hi> awaked very early, and having put on his cloaths, he called to the Groom of the Chamber, to come and aſſiſt <hi>Hortenſius</hi> to make himſelf ready (for he would have him to be obſerved with all reſpect) and he had the honour himſelf to bring him a clean ſhirt: In taking of the foul one, ſo rank a ſmell did ſurprize his Noſtril, that he could not forhear from ſpeaking to him; Wo is me how ſtrongly do you ſmell? And how do I ſmell? replyed
<hi>Hontenſius,</hi> Do not you conſider that I begin to appear to be a King in all things? Do you not perceive how much already I ſavour of
<hi>Alexander?</hi> 
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:59287:148"/>If your Armpits, ſaid
<hi>Audebert,</hi> do ſavour of <hi>Alexander,</hi> I am afraid your feet have the favour of <hi>Darius,</hi> who before he was a King, was ſometimes a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger. What! Are you become a Mocker (replyed <hi>Hortenſius?</hi>) But it is no matter, I take all in good part, I know that Kings have thoſe always near unto them who aſſume the liberty to ſpeak freely unto them, to ſolace and divert their ſpirits, otherwiſe they ſhould enjoy no pleaſure in this world. Iuſt as he ſpake this, Behold where <hi>Raymond, Francion, Du Buiſſon,</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini</hi> did come altogether to ſalute him, and demanded of him how he ſlept that night. He made anſwer, that he paſſed away the beſt part of it, in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the book of St.
<hi>Bridget,</hi> and ſhewed them the Prophecies which he had expounded to his advantage, by which they perceived that the greateſt part of this new King was Fool, and that their <hi>Plato</hi> was crowned with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſucceſſe. He who had wrote ſo many Romances found it not ſtrange at all, that from a poor Writer, he was become a King, ſeeing that he had often wrote of the like adventures, in which he could find nothing ſo truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the condition of a King, as he perceived in his own, and he was ſo accuſtomed to theſe things, that he found nothing extraordinary.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Francion, Raymond,</hi> and <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> did ſeriouſly entertain themſelves on theſe Prophecies, <hi>Du Buiſſon</hi> did interrupt them, and ſaid to <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> Be pleaſed to inform my Ignorance, I know not yet by what Title to call you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Title of Monſieur, or Monſigneur, or of Sire.
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> made anſwer, When I have the Crown upon my head, it will be good to call me Sire. For the preſent, I will content my ſelf with the Title of Monſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is no queſtion of it to be made, but you at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent are to bs entituled Sire; for you a long time have been King by merit, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not by condition. Do as you pleaſe then (replyed
<hi>Hortenſius,</hi>) But you <hi>Du Buiſſon,</hi> what is it that you would ſay unto me? Sir, I demand of you (ſaid <hi>Du Buiſſon</hi>) If being in <hi>Polonia</hi> you would not equally diſtribute Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice? And, as you recompence Vertue, whether you would not alſo puniſh Vice? And remembring thoſe who have heretofore offended you, whether you would not by ſome fair pretences draw them to your Court, to put them there to death? I have heard mention made of <hi>Eſcluſes,</hi> of <hi>Saluſt,</hi> the Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawer, and ſome Serjeants, who have not intreated you as they ought, Will you not call them to an account for it? <hi>Hortenſius</hi> having a little meditated with himſelf, did make anſwer, Underſtand me, It is not requiſite that the King of <hi>Polonia</hi> ſhould take care to revenge himſelf of the Injuries which were done to the Poet <hi>Hortenſius.</hi> I compoſe this Apothegm, having that of a King of of <hi>France</hi> for my Example, who after he was King, would not revenge himſelf of the Injuries done unto him when he was but Duke of <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> My readings in this Nature ſhall profit me much for the time to come, and I will write unto my Hoſteſſe of <hi>Paris</hi> to ſend me my Books of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places, which I have left in pawn with her for five and thirty Sous which I do owe her; When I have thoſe Books, no Subject ſhall be propounded to me, but I will have an anſwer ready, from thoſe of the antient Monarchs whoſe lives I have ſolded down. But until thoſe Books come, I will make uſe of
<hi>Plutarch,</hi> and the Collections of <hi>Eraſmus;</hi> And you, my dear Friends, who do now aſſiſt me, I will teach you, and I will give you all that I have, in the Imitation of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and reſerve to my ſelf only the Hope. Do you ſee what an application) make of things, and I will ſo continue them, that the Book which hereafter ſhall be made of my Hiſtory, ſhall be the moſt excellent one in the world. You
<hi>Audebert,</hi> it ſeems to me that your Humor is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, and curious enough, it ſhall be your imployment to collect all my Apothegms. In the morning you ſhall come unto me, and it ſhall be late at night before you depart from me, and ſometimes you ſhall lie all night in my
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59287:149"/>Chamber; for in the Night-time, if I awake, and ſpeak any thing at all, it will be ſure to be an Apothegm. <hi>Buiſſon</hi> interrupted him, and ſaid, What? If you ask for the Chamber-pot to make water, or what if you are married, will you entertain Madam the Queen with Apothegms only? Hold your peace (ſaid <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi>) it is not to you I ſpeak, it is to you my <hi>Audebert,</hi> who ſhall keep a Regiſter of that which every day I ſhall ſpeak of. It is an excellent invention, and which will coſt nothing. They keep a Regiſter of expences in every houſe, be it never ſo little; The Receivers and Treaſurers of Princes are imployed all the year in keeping of Accounts; And ſhall there not be a Man appointed punctually to ſet down whatſoever word the King doth ſpeak? I will not fall into that fault, and you ſhall be my Hiſtoriographer. What penſion will you allow me (Sir) ſaid <hi>Audebert?</hi> The King of <hi>Polonia</hi> made anſwer, You do precipitate too much to demand that queſtion. Be patient till I can ſee what acres I can ſpare, I cannot diſpoſe of places of Preferment to you, according to your expectation, until I am firſt acquainted with the Courſe of my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
            <p>As he ſpake that, <hi>Raymond</hi> told him, That he ſhould ſuddenly have the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to inform himſelf of the Eſtate in which his Kingdom was, and that the <hi>Polonians</hi> were invited to come to dinner to him. This news was very wellcom to him, being deſirous to know their humour. He was apparalleld as on the day before, in a Suit of Spaniſh cloath, of colour <hi>de Roy.</hi> They cauſed him to throw over his ſhoulder his little furred Coat, and they made faſt a great Brooch to his Hat, that he might the better appear in the <hi>Poloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> garb.</p>
            <p>After that he came down into the Hall, where not long afterwards the <hi>Germans</hi> came diſguiſed in <hi>Polonian</hi> habits; They did ſalute him with infinite reſpects, and made a great difficulty to be ſo bold as to dine with their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter at his own Table. To reconcile all,
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> ſate at the upper end, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving three or four places empty, and the company obſerving that diſtance, did ſit down on either ſide of the Table, which was a very long one. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of Dinner, all the diſcourſe was to his praiſe; Every action was admired, and he ſpake not a word, but it was cryed up for an Oracle, ſo that his preſumption did blind him more and more, and made him believe that all which he heard was true. When the cloath was taken away, there ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived many French Gentlemen, to whom
<hi>Raymond</hi> had imparted the drollery, who came to eſtabliſh a Court for <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> as if he had been a Prince of their own Nation; In the mean time <hi>Dorini</hi> addreſſed himſelf to <hi>Nays,</hi> to acquaint her with this Comedy, and to know if ſhe pleaſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain this delightfull Company. He no ſooner underſtood that ſhe would be moſt glad to ſee this new King, but immediatly he returned to acquaint
<hi>Francion</hi> with it, who demanded of <hi>Hortenſius</hi> if he would paſſe away that Afternoon with the moſt beautifull Lady in
<hi>Italy;</hi> He made anſwer, he ſhould be glad to ſolace himſelf with that divertiſement, and immediatly three Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaches were prepared for all the Company. He refuſed to goe abroad with his Coat lined with Furr, becauſe the <hi>Polonians</hi> had no ſuch attire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but it was repreſented to him, that they did not accuſtom themſelves to wear Furrs in that Country, becauſe it was a warm Climat, and although it was not unfaſhionable to have a Cloak unlined as was theirs, yet it would not become him to ſhew himſelf ſo moveable or uncertain, as to leave off that faſhion and habiliment which he had taken. In this manner they conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, and he took his Caroach, the <hi>Polonians</hi> being with him in it, and
<hi>Audebert,</hi> who was always to be with him, to write down whatſoever he ſaid. The other two Caroaches were filled with <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen, and they followed the former which was much looked upon by all the People. Some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved they were Maskers, &amp; that they were to dance ſome Mask, but they were <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59287:149"/>much amazed to ſee Mummeries at that ſeaſon of the year, which w <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s off from <hi>Shrovetide, Nays</hi> entertained them honourably, and at that time many invited Ladies did arrive to ſee the new King of <hi>Polonia.</hi> He ſhewed himſelf ſo courteous, that he would not ſit down unleſſe that they were ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alſo. For the Gentlemen to teſtifie their reſpect unto the Prince, were contented to be bareheaded, and to lean ſome againſt one place, and ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another. The firſt Complement which <hi>Nays</hi> ſpake, was, that ſhe was exceſſively glad of the happineſſe which was arrived to the moſt excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage in the world, and ſhe had now a reaſon to believe that God would deſtroy Mankind no more, becauſe he was pleaſed that the Scepter ſhould be given to ſuch a one, who would reſtore the Univerſe to its Primitive Beauty. That which (Madam) you ought more to admire (ſaid <hi>Buiſſon</hi>) is, that of a ſmall thing he hath vouchſafed to make a great one, as if a Pyramid ſhould ſtand on its own ſpire; and ſo indeed all things do increaſe, the ſmalleſt Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers do ſwell into a Sea, an Acorn grows into an Oak, and our King who was almoſt nothing, is now advanced into a Potentate. His life is governed by a Deſtiny, contrary to that of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Tyrant, who from a King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into a Pedant, but he from a Pedant is promoted to a King. Learn to ſpeak more modeſtly (ſaid
<hi>Hortenſius</hi>) How fooliſh and inconſiderate is your youth! I deny not (ſaid <hi>Hortenſius</hi>) that I ariſe but from ſmall begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, but what need this be ſpoken? We ought to forget all which is paſſed, as if it had never been, and we ought to believe that Fortune is drunk, and doth not know what ſhe hath done her ſelf, when ſhe ſendeth calamities un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Kings. How many Kings have been known to come from a ſordid pedigree, that have not been eſteemed the leſſe for that? <hi>Tamberlan</hi> was a Swineherd, <hi>Agathocles</hi> was the Son of a Potter, and to put him in remembrance of his Parentage, he commanded that they ſhould mingle Veſſels of Earth with thoſe of Gold and Silver. It is well known that
<hi>Auſonius</hi> who was a good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor Compoſed this Verſe. <hi>Fama eſt Fictilibus coenaſſe Agathoclea regem,</hi> &amp;c. But without going ſo far, One of the Kings, even of our <hi>Polonia,</hi> was a Labourer, and yet in memory of him, they laid up his Sandals in the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It is an obſervation of no uſe, Beſides it is well known, I am not of ſo baſe a Pedigree, and if peradventure I were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ought not to be eſteemed the leſs. Look in the Romances all over, and you ſhall find what a cognizance there is. <hi>Chariclea</hi> was believed to be the Daughter of a Prieſt, but ſhe was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved afterwards to be the Daughter of a King. <hi>Daphnis</hi> and
<hi>Chloe</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be the Children of a poor Shepherd, and it was afterwards diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that great Signiors were their Fathers; and I believe that the paſſages of my life being interwoven with ſo many wonders, I ſhall be acknowledged at laſt to be the Son of ſome great Prince. They will bring me my Cradle, my Muckinder, and my Hobbyhorſe garniſhed with pretious ſtones, which will add faith to the Nobility of my Race. My Heart tells me ſo, and I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is not in vain that I make this preſage, for the celeſtial inſpirations are never found to be Lyars. It is eaſie to be ſeen that I am of the Royal Progeny, for never any Man had ſo great a deſire to be King, as I have.</p>
            <p>All this which you repreſent unto us is true (ſaid
<hi>Francion</hi>) and moreover take notice that the year of <hi>Jubilee</hi> approacheth, and we ought not to doubt but that many Princes who have made clandeſtine marriages will then diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them to receive abſolution for their offences. I have heard it reported, that on the laſt <hi>Jubilee</hi> there were ſome Potentates who acknowledged in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner their own Children. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> did ſtill hold ſome diſcourſe in conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Subject, &amp; obſerving that <hi>Audebert</hi> did for bear to be attentive to him, being buſie in communication with <hi>Du Buiſſon,</hi> inſomuch, that although he had taken his Table Book, to write down all that which the King ſhould ſay, yet he had not of late written any thing at all, he made a ſign to him with his <pb n="21" facs="tcp:59287:150"/>eyes, and then ſaid unto him, <hi>Audebert,</hi> write down all, Do you not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that this is remarkable? I have put down all already, ſaving the Latin only (ſaid <hi>Audebert</hi>) Whereupon
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> all along did dictate to him the Epigrame of
<hi>Auſonius,</hi> believing it was ſomething of great conſequence to his life, which convayed an incredible pleaſure to the ſtanders by; But <hi>Du Buiſſon</hi> who could not hold his peace, did ſay unto him, Sir, I know but one word of Latin, and it is, <hi>Simia ſemper Simia.</hi> Heretofore you have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it your ſelf, and now you prove it. Obſerve but this Wagg (ſaid <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>) yeſterday when the Gentlemen of
<hi>Polonia</hi> had told me that their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patriots had given unto me the Scepter of that Nation, I believed that I ſhould want nothing but Jeaſters about me to be a King, but now I ſee I ſhall not fail of them. All theſe Anſwers of <hi>Hortenſius</hi> ſeemed admirable to the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by, and at every word the Ambaſſadours would lift up their hands to Heaven, ſpeaking with admiration in the Latin Tongue. O how great is this his wiſdom! He is as full of ſweetneſſe as of clemency! how contented ſhall our <hi>Polonia</hi> be to have him! <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, That to make Commonwealths flouriſh, Philoſophers muſt reign, or that Kings muſt be Philoſophers. Behold here one of thoſe Kings which he deſireth; Since we are informed that he hath been a Regent Maſter in the Univerſities, he muſt of neceſſity teach Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, which is the firſt part of Philoſophy, and he muſt have it alſo at his ſingers ends. Becauſe that <hi>Nays</hi> did not underſtand the Latin Tongue,
<hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> ſtood near unto her, and expounded every word what they ſaid. For the French Tongue ſhe did ſpeak it perfectly her ſelf.</p>
            <p>At the laſt, to put <hi>Hortenſius</hi> upon ſome agreeable diſcourſe, ſhe of her own accord did ſay unto him, that ſhe had heard he had a deſire to compoſe five or ſix excellent Romances, ſome part whereof he had begun, ſhe demanded of him if he would now take the pains to continue them. He made anſwer, that he now had other things to doe, and that he might have Scholars enough to accompliſh them for him. As for himſelf, he was ſo reſolved, that words ſhould give place to actions, for he had an extreme deſire utterly to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the race of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> and advance his own perſon to conquer the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dumaen</hi> palmes, ſo that he was determined to put all into Armes, as ſoon as he ſhould come into
<hi>Polonia.</hi> Remember me then I beſeech you (ſaid <hi>Du Buiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>) and give me a company of <hi>Carabins</hi> upon the Sea. Go too then (ſaid <hi>Hortenſius</hi>) you ſhall have a Company, but I believe that you merit rather the place of the Kings Fool, than any other.</p>

               <hi>Francion</hi> fearing that the King of <hi>Polonia</hi> would grow into a choler, and that <hi>Du Buiſſon</hi> would not be able to contain himſelf, did alter the ſcene of the diſcourſe, and ſaid unto
<hi>Hortenſius,</hi> But what are the Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances which you will eſtabliſh to make your people happy? I would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeak of this, replyed <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> that the <hi>Poloniſh</hi> Gentlemen who are here preſent may underſtand me, I will therefore that my Eſtate be made famous, as much for Letters as for Arms, and the rather, to ſoften the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born humour of the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> who are a Martial people, I will cauſe a whole dozen of Poets to come from <hi>Paris,</hi> who ſhall eſtabliſh an Academy, and give Laws for Poeſie and Romances. My deſire is, that all the world ſhall make Books in my Kingdom, and on all Subjects. The Romances ſhall be no more of Love and War only, but they ſhall contain as well ſubjects of Law, of Merchandiſe, and of Receipts of the Exchequer, In this courſe of Affairs there ſhall be dayly brave and new adventures. No man before me had ever the leaſt imagination of this; I am the Maſter of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. In this manner the Draper ſhall make Romances on his traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick, and the Advocate on his practice. All the world ſhall be good Company, and Men ſhall ſpeak nothing but Romances, and Verſes ſhall be in ſuch reputation, that a certain price ſhall be ſet upon them.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59287:150"/>He who hath no Money, and preſenteth a Stanza to a Taverner, ſhall receive for his pains a quarter of a pint, half a pint for a Sonnet, a pint for an Ode, and a quart of Wine for a Poem, and ſo higher for other pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. This will provide well for the neceſſities of the people; For Bread, Meat, Wood, Candie, Cloath and Silks, ſhall be bought according to the price which ſhall be ſet upon Verſe, whoſe ſubject ſhall be the praiſe of Merchants, and their Merchandizes. This Comfort ſhall poor Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets have, when they have no money. This will I eſtabliſh for Commerce. For that which belongs to Iuſtice, it ſhall be upright as brief. If the cauſe be full of perplexity, it ſhall be unraveli'd and expounded at the charge of him who ſhall gain it, or he ſhall have the Law to paſſe on his ſide who ſhall be the moſt learned Man. As for the Laws of War, No man ſhall be entertained into the place of a Captain, who hath not by heart <hi>Amadis de Gaul,</hi> and the <hi>Knight of the Sunne;</hi> for without thoſe Books a Man cannot be couragious. For other things, I have many Stratagems to rout the
<hi>Turks,</hi> I will cauſe Men to be mounted on Chariots which ſhall appear all in Fire, there ſhall be jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins and Lances of Fire, Granadoes and Petarbs, and many Blazing Starres, and Dragons flaming in the air, that the Barbarians beholding how I imitate the Thunderer, the Comets and the Starrs, ſhall believe that I am ſomething greater than <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf. I will have great Circles of Chriſtal, on the back whereof I will cauſe certain lights to be placed, which ſhall make them ſhine as the Bow in Heaven; ſo will I counterfeit the party-coloured <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How will theſe Viſions trouble my Enemies? How ſhall they be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with the affrighting noiſe which my people ſhall make, who overcome, and they themſelves who ſhall be overcome?</p>
            <p>Theſe Inventions of <hi>Hortenſius</hi> were found to be excellent, but <hi>Audebert</hi> did not forbear to acquaint him, that he was amazed to ſee him reſolved on ſo many and ſo great Combats; for ſometimes he had heard him ſay, that he would never go to War, but when the Muskets ſhould be charged with <hi>Cyprian</hi> powder, and laden with pellets of Sugar, and the powder in the pan ſhould be the powder of
<hi>Orras.</hi> He made anſwer, That he feared not the Alarms of war, becauſe he had the Right on his ſide, and that neither force or Stratagem ſhould be ever ſeen to be wanting in him.</p>
            <p>Whiles he ſpake this, the Ambaſſadors conſulted together, and <hi>Francion,</hi> who was their Interpreter, made known unto him, that they could not approve what their King ſaid, for they were afraid, that the Grandies of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try would not give way to have their antient Laws to be exchanged into new; but <hi>Hortenſius</hi> ſaid, That they ſhould then ſee what would be done, when he ſhould prove unto them that his Propoſitions were juſt.</p>
            <p>One of the Ladies in the Company of <hi>Nays</hi> being very curious, deſired to know if the King of <hi>Polonia</hi> had not a reſolution to marry, and <hi>Francion</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the queſtion to him. He replyed, That he perceived well enough that there was ſome
<hi>Italian</hi> Baggage who deſired to be a Queen; but ſhe was miſtaken, for he would have none but either ſome Daughter of the Royal bloud of
<hi>England,</hi> or of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who above all things, ſhould bring her chaſtity for her Dowry. The <hi>Polonians</hi> acquainted
<hi>Francion</hi> with what they conceived fit to be done; and he ſpake aloud unto the Company, That the Ambaſſadors were afraid their King would but deceive himſelf, if he thought ever to have a Wife who had yet the Roſe of her Virginity, becauſe it was the cuſtom of their Country, to put their Queen, the firſt day of her Marriage, into a great cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where all the Grandies of the Realm did lie with her one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59287:151"/>This did put <hi>Hortenſius</hi> into a great choler, who proteſted he would never endure that Villany, and that he had read the Chapter of <hi>Polonia</hi> all over in the Book of Eſtates and Empires, but it made not the leaſt mention of ſo exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable a Cuſtom. The Ambaſſadors maintained that it had alwayes been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; and that to know if a Man hath a crooked noſe, he muſt not look upon his Picture, but he muſt look upon himſelf, and if his Book were a lyar, or a flatterer, he muſt not give ſo much credit to it, as to any thing which properly did belong unto him, and that for their own parts they had no mind to aboliſh the good Cuſtom of their Country, to lie with their Queen; for being the prime and firſt of the Eſtate, they were to taſt firſt of all of the Wife of their King. The Ladies were all for them in that behalf; and although that
<hi>Du Buiſſon</hi> affirmed, that he ſhould take heed how he married in that year of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, for, without all doubt, by the diſordered and too haſty revolution of the Sphere, when his Wife ſhould be in the ſign of
<hi>Gemini,</hi> he would be in that of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> yet they counſelled him not to lead a ſingle life, aſſuring him, that he ſhould never be deceived in his Queen.</p>
            <p>After there ſeveral Entertainments, all the Company, ſaving
<hi>Francion,</hi> took their leave of <hi>Nays,</hi> and they brought back the King of <hi>Polonia</hi> to his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: There was a great Preſſe of People to ſee him paſſe by. The report of his folly was ſpred over all
<hi>Rome.</hi> Some laughed, and others were amazed at it. For himſelf, he believed that the Multitude was only to admire him, and being well ſatisfied in his own particular; he locked himſelf up in his Chamber as ſoon as poſſibly he could, with his Hiſtoriographer, to cauſe him to read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to him whatſoever he had writ of his Diſcourſe at the Houſe of
<hi>Nays,</hi> to correct them in ſeveral places where they failed.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Francion</hi> entertained his Miſtreſſe with the pleaſant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances of this new King; and, to make amends for the time in which they kept a ſerious Countenance before him, they now both of them laughed their fill. But becauſe this was not that which did moſt nearly concern them, they ſoon did alter the ſubject of their diſcourſe. <hi>Francion</hi> did acquaint her with the violence of his paſſion, and <hi>Nays</hi> was ſo touched with a tranſportation of Love, that ſhe did take out of a little Box the Picture of
<hi>Floriander,</hi> which ſhe had yet reſerved, and did give it to him to do what he would with it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting to him, That ſhe would not regard any thing whatſoever, that ſhould make her think of any other but himſelf. He made ſome difficulty to take it, alleging, That he doubted not of her Fidelity, and that he was not of ſo outragious a temper, as to enter into a jealouſie. Nevertheleſſe he did take it along with him, and on his return he did preſent it unto <hi>Baymond. Nays</hi> being a Widdow, although ſhe was the Miſtreſſe of her actions, yet ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Counſel of her Kinred concerning her Marriage, who although they were not altogether ſatisfied that ſhe ſhould marry a ſtranger, yet they pretended to like well of it, becauſe they did know her to be entire in her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and that ſhe would not forſake them for any Remonſtrances of theirs.
<hi>Francion</hi> had already made a viſit to ſome of them with
<hi>Dorini,</hi> and ſhewed many excellent proofs of his abilities; but their Diſpoſition was not ſo tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as to be taken with him the firſt or ſecond time. Nevertheleſſe the affair did ſo far advance it ſelf, that the Marriage was to be ſolemnized within ſix dayes. Our Lover thought the time long, and did languiſh during this delay, ſo that he had reaſon to ſeek ſome recreation to divert himſelf amongſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances of
<hi>Hortenſius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being returned to him, he cauſed him to ſup with him, in the ſame Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as at Dinner, and Night being come, he did ſleep in the ſame bed as he did the Night before. The Ambaſſadors demanded of him, when he would be pleaſed to depart, and take upon him the Government of
<hi>Polonia,</hi> which lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for his preſence? He made anſwer, It ſhould be when they pleaſed; but <pb n="24" facs="tcp:59287:151"/>
               <hi>Francion</hi> interpoſed, and told him, that ſuddenly he was to be married, and that he muſt do him the honour as to aſſiſt at his Marriage, which being cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, they would joyfully go all together, with all the French Gentlemen in <hi>Rome,</hi> and that other Nations would follow him alſo, of which he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an Army, which would make him formidable in all the places he ſhould come. The <hi>Polonian</hi> Gentlemen did allege, that they had a Command to make no delay at all in their journey; but their Monark did ſwear unto them, That on this fair occaſion which offered it ſelf, he would ſtay, although he ſhould loſe all his Provinces and his Royalties to boot. At this the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors ſeemed to be diſcontented, and, in a garb which ſhewed themſelves to be much unſatisfied, departed from him with very few Complements. He cauſe them to be called back, and did appeaſe them, demanding of them, What was the reaſon they were not ſatisfied? They made anſwer, That their deſire was, that they may be lodged in the ſame Houſe with him; for it was the Cuſtom of their Princes to allow Chambers in their Palaces to all thoſe of their quality. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> made anſwer, He would do that, and more alſo, and that he would come and take up his Lodgings with them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he did riſe, and made himſelf ready to goe unto their Houſe with them: and although themſelves did not well like of it, yet they did conduct him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, alleging they ſhould receive a great Contentment by it, becauſe for the time to come they ſhould alwayes have their King with them, and obſerve his Diſpoſition to be conformable unto theirs. They did prepare for him the beſt Bed they had, but on the next Morning, having very early put on their riding cloaths to travel to
<hi>Naples,</hi> they diſlodged without Trumpets, and paying their Hoſt but half of the account that was due unto him, they did aſſure him, that their Companion, whom they had left behind them, would diſcharge the reſt.</p>
            <p>When he was thoroughly awake, the Hoſt entred into his Chamber, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, If he would have the expences of his Companions put in the ſame Bill of Affair with his own? He made anſwer, That he was not yet to depart his Houſe; But the Hoſt replyed, The reſt are all gone.
<hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi> demanded, If there was never a <hi>Polonian</hi> left in his Houſe? To whom the Hoſt replyed, There was never any <hi>Polonian</hi> lodged here, I only do deſire to know, If you will be reſponſible for the four <hi>Almans</hi> which are gon, ſeeing they honoured you as their Maſter.</p>
            <p>They were in this Diſcourſe, when the firſt Hoſt, in whoſe Houſe <hi>Hortenſius</hi> lodged, having heard at <hi>Raymonds</hi> Lodgings where to find him, did enter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo into his Chamber, and making a great complaint againſt him, he demanded of him the Rent for his Chamber, and other moneys due for other expences, and called him Impoſtor, for going away without bidding him Adieu, becauſe he had not an Intent to pay him.
<hi>Audebert,</hi> who at <hi>Raymonds</hi> Lodgings had directed the Hoſt where to find <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> and ſuſpected the quarrel that would be betwixt them, did follow him afarre off, and found <hi>Hortenſius</hi> in a hot diſputation with the two <hi>Italians. Hortenſius</hi> ſeeing him, was ſurprized with joy, and cryed out, Ah <hi>Audebert!</hi> You are come in a good time, theſe two Brothers in Oppreſſion and Deceit do tyrannize over me, without reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my quality. Declare unto them that I ſhall be a King, and ſhall have Means enough to diſcharge them.
<hi>Audebert,</hi> having taken pleaſure enough by their Conteſtation, did appeaſe the two Hoſts, promiſing them that <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi> ſhould pay them very honeſtly, and that he would paſſe his word for him, ſo that they returned him his cloaths again on which, they had laid their hands, and principally on the little Coat lined with Furr, having a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to have ſold them all, and to pay themſelves what he owed them; for they would not intreat him more reſpectfully, ſeeing he ſeemed to them to be but a very Fool.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:59287:152"/>
               <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> having quickly put on his cloaths, did depart with <hi>Aud-bert,</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering himſelf with an ordinary Cloak; for he would wear that which was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Furr no longer, becauſe he had none of the <hi>Polonians</hi> to follow him. He repaired to
<hi>Raymond</hi> and <hi>Franc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on,</hi> and all the way as he did go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long be was in a great diſtemper; when he was come to them he made his complaints that the
<hi>Polonians</hi> were gone without bidding him Farewell, which was the true ſign of a great incivility in them, for which he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture any cauſe. You ſee (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) that they are diſcontented at you. Yeſterday you propounded new Laws, which, being King, you would obſerve in their Country, to the prejudice of their antient government, I do believe it did much diſpleaſe them, and moreover you did not intreat them with that Honour and Courteſie which they expected; As ſoon as ever you had heard of their arrival, you ought to have accomodated them with a fair houſe, and rich moveables, and to have entertained them at your expence, and after that you had given them audience, you ought to have ſhewed your ſelf liberal, and have given to the principal of them a Seal heavy with Diamonds, and to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of the reſt a great Chain of Gold. Theſe are the gifts which Princes at this day do beſtow on the Ambaſſadours ſent to them, and ſometimes they doe give things which are more pretious. It may be ſo (ſaid <hi>Hortenſius</hi>) but I never obſerved it in any Book.
<hi>Francion</hi> replyed, The chiefeſt Book which you can read, is the Experience of the world. The preſent <hi>mode</hi> of theſe times it but a folly to me (ſaid <hi>Hortenſius</hi>) I do govern my ſelf according to the Antients, and having nothing to beſtow upon them, I did reſerve my boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to a better opportunity.</p>
            <p>But tell me, What think you of it? Did not they ſay yeſterday, that they could not attend any long time for me, having a charge to return with all ſpeed. This, no doubt, was the ground of their ſudden departure. For our parts we will follow them as ſoon as your Marriage ſhall be ſolemnized. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> replyed, Betwixt this and that we will take further Counſel; I am afaid they will not have you for their King, and that they are gone to ſpeak evil of you in their own Country.</p>
            <p>Theſe laſt words did leave a deep impreſſion in the heart of <hi>Hortenſius.</hi> He conſidered with himſelf, that poſſibly he had loſt the Kingdom of <hi>Polonia</hi> by his own fault, and that he ſhould have borrowed round ſums of money, and put himſelf into a garb to have received and honoured the Ambaſſadours. But <hi>Raymond,</hi> to comfort him, ſaid unto him, For what do you afflict your ſelf? If you ſhall not be King, you ſhall not be leſſe at the worſt than you were ten days agoe. What pleaſure could you have to command a barbarous and an unknown people? It is better by far to be a Peer at home, than a King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and to be a Companion, as you always are, with men of gallant and ingenious ſpirits. A King is nothing elſe but an honourable Servant; The people are merry or aſleep, when he is awake, and hath his head full of cares for them. When the Diadem was brought to <hi>Seleucus,</hi> did not he ſay, that he who knew the griefs and cares which it covered, would not deign to take it up from the Earth? and have you not read in <hi>Plutark</hi> many other excellent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples concerning this ſubject?</p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe touched the very Soul of <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> who immediatly, to overcome his affliction, cauſed a Book to be brought unto him, the ſubject whereof was, <hi>The contempt of Worldly Creatures,</hi> on which he did amuze his Spirit, whilſt the others did ſolace themſelves with all varieties of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion,</hi> obſerving that this Pedant did fall into a humour which brought no pleaſure to them, did paſſe away the greateſt part of that day in diſcourſe with his Miſtreſſe, and the day following, conſidering that <hi>Hortenſius</hi> could furniſh them no more with accuſtomed entertainments of delight, inſtead of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59287:152"/>his natural Comedy, had recourſe to the <hi>Italian</hi> Comedians, who came to play at <hi>Nays</hi> houſe. He found them to be a gallant Company, and after a few days he acquainted them with all the pleaſant ſtories of this brave Maſter of his, when he was in the College under him, This was the only plot of their play, and at that time Signior
<hi>Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tor</hi> acted the part of the Pedant. <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi> was preſent at this Comedy but he thought it was not concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of whom they ſpake, he had too good an opinion of himſelf, to think would make plays of his actions.</p>
            <p>The next morning the Comedians acted another play at
<hi>Raymonds</hi> Houſe. The Plot was a new invention, and compoſed of divers languages, which were but as a Medley, ſo that thoſe who underſtood the <hi>Ita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> Tongue might eaſily apprehend them all. But on the day following there was a more famous company of Comedians, who had a Stage to act on. <hi>Francion, Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, Audebert, Du Buiſſon,</hi> and two other <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen, had not long before, given them a Comedy, in which they had all a hand; It was acted at
<hi>Nays</hi> houſe: They had made it ſpeedily, and very familiarly. It was altogether of Verſes, which they had taken out of <hi>Roaſard, Belleau, Buif, Deſportes, Garnier,</hi> and other modern Poets: They made uſe of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what they had already by heart, ſo that they had accommodated their Comedy according to that which was in their own Spirits, when others do captivate their Spirits to the rules and diſcourſes of Comedy. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe theſe pieces being hanſomly brought together did ſuit very well, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was fantaſtical enough. There were only ſome Melancholy <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> who took no pleaſure in it, becauſe they could not but with difficulty comprehend the <hi>French</hi> Poeſie.
<hi>Francion</hi> did indeavour to content theſe men with another device. The next day he cauſed a Comedy to be acted, which all manner of Nations could underſtand, for it was acted only by ſignes. He had cauſed it to be played in <hi>France</hi> once before; The ſigns and geſtures were ſo familiar, that in a ſhort time the Spectators might eaſily underſtand it.</p>
            <p>Although he exerciſed himſelf in all theſe Fancies and Inventions, as we have ſaid, yet they were not ſo long or tedious, but he had ſome time remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to intertain his Miſtreſſe. The day following was altogether dedicated to theſe affairs. The Company whom they had invited ſupped that Evening with <hi>Nays.</hi> Signior <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was not forgotten, who, ſeeing all the world diſpoſed unto mirth, was conſtrained to the ſame himſelf, although he was not now taken for a King, and had no more ſuch great honour done unto him. And although ſome amongſt them did begin to be ſerious, yet he would be now a little frolick, and having in his hand a Venice glaſſe made in the faſhion of a Gondalo, he ſaid, that thoſe Philoſophers were of all the moſt certain, who affirmed, that there were ſhips on the land, and that mean it by ſuch a Veſſel as that; and ſeeing <hi>Audebert</hi> about to drink, he ſaid unto him, Take heed how you put good wine into a bad Veſſel: What! Do you think (ſaid <hi>Audebert</hi>) I will pour this wine down your throat?
<hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi> finding himſelf to be hit ſo home, did change the diſcourſe, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two Partridges in one diſh, he told
<hi>Audebert</hi> that there were three Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges, and did attempt to perſwade him to it, ſaying oftentimes unto him. One and Two are Three.
<hi>Audebert,</hi> to put an end to his Sophiſtical diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did give one of the Partridges to <hi>Buiſſon,</hi> and took the other himſelf, and ſaid unto <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> the third is for you, Do you take it.
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> obſerving himſelf ſo mocked, was deſirous to be revenged, and the better to ſhew the ſubtilty of his Spirit, there were directly before him four Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons in another diſh, by which he conceived he ſhould be able to prove his former manner of argument to be of ſome value. He pretented one of them to two ſtrange Gentlemen, who laughed at him, and ſaid, One and Two are <pb n="27" facs="tcp:59287:153"/>Three, and afterwards he preſented another to <hi>Audebert</hi> and <hi>Du Buiſſon,</hi> and repeated the former words; which having done, he took the other two, and did put them on his own Trencher, ſaying, One and Two are Three. This Device did pleaſe ſo well, that even thoſe who were deceived did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it; But
<hi>Francion,</hi> and the other Gallants who ſat above, could not take notice of it, becauſe the Table was long, and there were many who ſate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; but it was ſoon publiſhed, and <hi>Francion</hi> commending it, ſaid, He remembred that <hi>Hortenſius</hi> once before did play his part as handſomly: For when I was (ſaid he) in the College under him, a Gentleman who was my Kinſman, did come to <hi>Paris</hi> with his Family, and invited us to a Supper. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things, there was a Pheaſant on the Table, Monſieur the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogue was intreated to cut it up, and to diſtribute it; He gave the Head to the Maſter of the Feaſt, ſaying, that it belonged to him, being Chief at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; He gave the Neck to his Wife, becauſe ſhe was joyned to the Head, as was that; To the two Daughters he gave the two Leggs, becauſe (he ſaid) they loved Dancing; And to his Son, and to my ſelf, he gave the two Wings, making us believe that it was our part, becauſe, being young Gentlemen, we ought to love the Hawk on his Wing; For himſelf, he reſerved the Body, ſaying, He ought to have it, as repreſenting the Body of the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>Paris.</hi>

            <p>In the purſute of this Account they entred by degrees, and as were inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly upon others, where <hi>Francion</hi> made ſo apparent his Wit, that all the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talians</hi> who were preſent, had afterwards for his own particular, the whole people of <hi>France</hi> in greater Eſtimation. As for <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> He would alſo ſet forth himſelf, and that knowledge which he had; And as the Muſicians were playing and ſinging, he did exerciſe his Eloquence in the Praiſes of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and aſſured them, That the paſſions and affections of Men, did repreſent the ſeverall parts of Muſick; Humility (he ſaid) did bear the Baſe, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition the Trebble; Choler did bear the Tenor, and Revenge the Counter-Tenor; Prudence did keep Time; Nature did ſing the plain Song, Artifice did quaver, Grief made the ſtops, ſighs, and Diſſimulation the feignings; And for the Inſtruments of Muſick, Avarice played on the Harp, Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity on the Cornet, but not on the Melodious Cornet, but out of that Horn out of which the Gameſter doth throw his Dice; Love playeth on the Violl, becauſe it doth violate the Girls; Treaſon playes on the lewes-Trump, for it trumpeth all the World; and Iuſtice playes on the Hault-boyes, becauſe ſhe raiſeth up that Gibbet, on which the Malefactors are exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
            <p>Theſe new applications gave much pleaſure to all the Company, and they intreated the Doctor to make a more particular explication of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he had ſpoken in reference of the paſſions to Muſick, which he did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willingly, believing that all the world admired him. After that, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that <hi>Raymond</hi> did ſometimes joyn with the Muſicians in the Song, he did praiſe him to the Skies, and told him, That he ſhould acknowledge himſelf moſt happy, if he could alwayes hear him. You are too full of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (ſaid <hi>Raymond</hi>) Muſt I hold my peace then, (ſaid <hi>Hortenſius</hi>) when I behold an accompliſhed perſonage? You do equivocate now, (ſaid <hi>Raymond.</hi>) I will make it appear (ſaid <hi>Hortenſius</hi>) it is no Equivocation; for I will ſhew you from whence the word Complementer is derived, <hi>Menteur</hi> in
<hi>French,</hi> is a Lyar, and a Complementer is no more than an accompliſhed <hi>Menteur,</hi> that is to ſay, an accompliſhed Lyar. To pleaſe <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> they made him believe that he had ſpoken far better than <hi>Raymond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Gueſts were all departed, and <hi>Hortenſius</hi> ſtayed only behind with theſe brave Gentlemen of <hi>France, Francion</hi> demanded of him, what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e thought of
<hi>Nays?</hi> and if he did not believe that he was happy to have ſo
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59287:153"/>fair a Miſtreſſe? <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> who had not wiſdom enough to conceal what he thought, made anſwer, That thoſe who marry Widdows, had no better Viands than Meat twice heated, and at the leaſt diſcontent which theſe Wives ſhould receive from their ſecond Husbands, they would upbraid them with their former. But <hi>Raymond</hi> arriving when theſe words were ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, did affirm, That it was not to be feared, but that <hi>Nays</hi> would find ſuch qualities in the perſon of
<hi>Francion,</hi> that it would make her to forget her firſt affections. For my ſelf (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) I cannot perceive that it will be any wayes diſadvantagious to me to eſpouſe a Widdow; She knows beſt what it is to love; I muſt of neceſſity have one; &amp; if ſhe hath had an Intereſt in another Man beſides my ſelf, what of that? How many Women have I known for that one Man? They had other Diſcourſe on this Subject, after <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> was retired, and <hi>Francion</hi> declared, That nothing could diſſwade him from his choice of <hi>Nays,</hi> but that moſt highly he did eſteem his Fortune; for all the Reaſons that could be alleged, were not able to divert him from his Love, and his Deſign of Marriage. He did begin to look on all things with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother eye than he had done heretofore, and did believe it was now high time to make an honeſt retreat.</p>

            <head>THE TWELFTH BOOK OF THE COMICAL HISTORY OF
<hi>FRANCION.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S theſe two perfect Lovers did diſcourſe together of their Affairs, there unexpectedly arrived a certain Gentleman, who was called Signior
<hi>Bergamin,</hi> with whom <hi>Francion</hi> had before ſome little acquaintance, he did conceive very well of him, becauſe he was of a moſt pleaſant converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He gave him good Entertainment, and told him, that be wondred wherefore he ſo long had abſented himſelf, and that he had loſt much Mirth, becauſe he had not been in their Company, having had much variety of delightfull Intertainment, and Comedies acted of all ſorts, as well true, as feigned; Thereupon he made a ſhort account of all that had paſſed concerning <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> and of their other recreations that followed afterwards: But <hi>Bergamin</hi> had ſuch little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, that he had not the leaſt knowledge of it. He ſaid, He was ſorry his affairs had hindred him from having the honour to delight himſelf in their Company. <hi>Francion</hi> replyed. That he muſt now make them amends for the time which they had ſpent without him, by a long enjoyment of his agreeable Company. He did not ſpeak this without Cauſe; for, to ſpeak the truth, he could not find in all <hi>Italy</hi> ſo pleaſant a Man as
<hi>Bergamin,</hi> or more proper for thoſe Recreations which they invented. In his Youth he had been a Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian himſelf, and was eſteemed the chief of that profeſſion. Having left it off, it was all his Imployment to wait upon Courtiers, and to viſit ſometimes one, and ſometimes another, and to play a thouſand tricks before them. It was reported alſo, that it was no longer expedient that he ſhould continue in the Company of the Actors, becauſe he was able to act a whole Comedy himſelf. And to ſpeak the truth, they were not deceived who made that Report; for there were ſome Parts which were made on purpoſe for him, which he often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times would act without having need of a Second; and having a Curtain drawn in the upper Corner of the Hall, he would oftentimes come forth, changing his habit according to the conditions of the perſons whom he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and he would ſo diſguiſe his Voice and Action, that he was not to be known; ſo that one would think there were divers other actors with him. This indeed might ſerve for thoſe Scenes, in which but one Man was to be upon the Stage; but where there were to be two or more, he uſed ſome other artifice, in which he was not to ſeek. As for example, He would ſometimes act the perſon of a Lover, ſpeaking unto his Miſtreſſe, whom he counterfeited to be <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59287:154"/>locked up in Priſon by her angry Father, or her jealous Husband, he would turn towards the wall to entertain her, and when it came to her turn to ſpeak, he would counterfeit a womans Voice, and ſo different from the former, that one would verily believe, there were ſome Woman ſpeaking behind the Arras; for he would turn his back on purpoſe, that no man might ſee his lips to move. Sometimes alone by himſelf he would repreſent a pleaſant Mummery, and would ſhew his art very delightfully, acting three or four perſons as they were ſpeaking to one another upon the Theater. He had a ſupply of Gowns, Cloaks, Hats and Bonnets, which he ſuddenly would change in the Preſence of the Spectators, without going behind the Arras. When he acted the part of a King, he would ſit in a chair, and ſpeak gravely to ſome Courtier, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly afterwards he would put off his royal habiliments, and his Crown, and riſing up from the chair, he would put himſelf into the poſture of a Knight; and being afterwards to repreſent the part of a Country Clown, he would paſſe chearfully to it, and being clad in raggs, he would act his part ſo much unto the life, that there could nothing be beheld more delightfull. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he would take to the Chair of State again, and be in the quality of a Prince, and would change his Place, his Habit, and his Voice ſo often, that it was truly wonderfull.</p>
            <p>This could he do as a Comedian, ſo that, without diſſimulation, he might have been of great uſe in the gallantries of
<hi>Francion,</hi> who had reaſon to be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for his abſence. For the reſt, he had ſo extraordinary an underſtanding, that his familiar Diſcourſes were alwayes filled with remarkable Obſervations, and none in pleaſance did exceed him. By reaſon of this, he was welcom to all great perſonages; Nevertheleſſe he was but very poor, for not applying himſelf to any one of them in particular, he had no conſtant Penſion to entertain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. They were glad to have his Company at Dinner; but they who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him at their Table, did as great Men are accuſtomed to do, who imagine they do thoſe Men much honour and pleaſure, whom they permit to eat with them. And yet he muſt be a jocular, and a frolick Companion with them; for if he had been melancholy, or ſilent,, he ſhould not have been welcom ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time.</p>
            <p>He was in the number of thoſe Men who had ordinarily a good Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but ſeldom a Supper; for Suppers are rare in great Mens houſes, and the entertainment of the Kitchin is but cold. He was very glad to have obtained the acquaintance of <hi>Francion,</hi> who lived ſplendidly, after the manner of the French; but of late, upon ſome occaſions, he had diſcontinued his Company. He ſeemed now to be much changed, and to put on a ſerious Countenance, as if he had ſomething on his Spirit that did much perplex it, and after his firſt Complement, he teſtified, that he would impart a Secret of great Importance to him.</p>
            <p>And this he did without ſpeaking any word, for he would not that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign ſhould be diſcovered; he did therefore take him aſide into a retired place of the Parlor, where they might not be underſtood.
<hi>Raymond</hi> conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that it was done on purpoſe, and being a diſcreet Man, he kept himſelf at a diſtance, and would not hear what his Friends had no deſire to communicate unto him. <hi>Bergamin</hi> demanded of
<hi>Francion,</hi> How long it was ſince he had ſeen the fair
<hi>Emilia,</hi> who was an <hi>Italian</hi> Lady, with whom he was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſince he came to <hi>Rome? Francion,</hi> ſeeming to give no great ear unto the Queſtion, did ask him, If he did not yet hear what the whole City talked of, That he ſhould marry <hi>Nays?</hi> and told him moreover, That being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to her, he could no longer attend to viſit other Ladies. I know, ſaid <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamin,</hi> that your promiſe made to <hi>Nays</hi> is the publick Diſcourſe of this City; but it is not more ſtrong and more obligatory, than your promiſe made unto <hi>Emilia,</hi> which was before ſo many Witneſſes: Moreover, the firſt promiſes <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59287:155"/>do oblige us, and do render us incapable to make any other.
<hi>Francion</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, You do much amaze me to ſpeak unto me in this manner; But you more amaze me, ſaid <hi>Bergamin,</hi> to pretend to be ſurprized with amazement. <hi>Francion</hi> made anſwer, I am no wayes obliged to <hi>Emilia.</hi> But ſhe allegeth, that you are (ſaid
<hi>Bergamin</hi>) ſo that you cannot marry with <hi>Nays,</hi> as you propound unto your ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bergamin</hi> ſpoke this with a moſt ſober countenance; But <hi>Francion</hi> concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it to be but a device, and that
<hi>Bergamin</hi> did but play with him, ſo that the more
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he did ſpeak, the more did
<hi>Francion</hi> remain without belief, and ſaid unto him, I perceive well enough that you are in Jeaſt; But whom do you play with? It is with me who have given Leſſons unto others; you, poſſibly do believe, that I know not ſo much as your ſelf, It may be ſo, yet at leaſt I know well enough how to defend my ſelf from your artifices; let my deer <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> partake of this contentment with us.</p>
            <p>Thereupon he called <hi>Raymond,</hi> who of himſelf was very glad to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, for by the manner of their Diſcourſe he conceived that there was ſomething of extraordinary importance; when he was approached,
<hi>Francion</hi> told him, that <hi>Bergamin</hi> was one of the moſt delightfull Companions in the world, and that he would make him to believe that he had promiſed marriage to <hi>Emilia. Raymond,</hi> who had heard ſome Diſcourſe concerning that Lady, did begin to give ear to what was ſpoken; but <hi>Bergamin</hi> redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his aſſurances, did ſpeak in this manner; I am glad that you have called hither a witneſſe, for you ſhall both perceive that I ſpeak nothing, but what is to the purpoſe, and moſt credible. Take heed <hi>Francion</hi> that you are not deceived your ſelf; I proteſt unto you, that <hi>Emilia</hi> hath aſſured me that you have promiſed to marry her upon the faith of a Gentlemen, and that you ought not to conclude any thing with <hi>Nays</hi> to the prejudice of your Word and Honour; Her Mother hath requeſted me to come unto you, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you not to be ſo diſloyal as to proceed further in that marriage. To this
<hi>Bergamin</hi> did joyn a long Diſcourſe againſt the unfaithfullneſſe of Lovers, where he ſhewed the excellence of his memory in reciting ſeveral Authors which he had read, and he made apparent alſo the vivacity of his Spirit, in appropriating ſeveral choice things of his own invention. Sometimes he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged himſelf, and gave more grace unto his words by the geſture of an Orator, and kept his Countenance ſo well, that he ſeemed to be as excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent an Orator, as he was a Comedian.
<hi>Francion</hi> knew not well how he ſhould deport himſelf, whether he ſhould laugh, or whether he ſhould be angry, Nevertheleſſe he ſaid unto <hi>Bergamin,</hi> that by how much the better he did ſpeak, by ſo much he did teſtifie, that he knew the better how to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<hi>Bergamin</hi> made anſwer, that, in truth, <hi>Francion</hi> had ſeen ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick fictions proceed from him, but they were appropriated to ſuch perſons as deſerved to be abuſed, and not to <hi>Francion,</hi> who ought to be intreated in another manner, and that he was reſolved to ſpeak no more unto him, for ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly he would hear of other aſſurances, which would be more forcible than any which he had ſpoken of as yet: Speaking thoſe words he departed in a great paſſion, to obſerve, that becauſe heretofore he was accuſtomed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate with Fables, they did now believe, that he neither was, or ever could be able to ſpeak one word of Truth.</p>
            <p>By this manner of his abrupt departure, it was collected, That what he did ſpeak was in earneſt, for had it been in jeaſt, he would have at laſt turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to laughter all that he had ſaid, knowing well enough that he had not novices to deal with. When he was departed, <hi>Raymond</hi> ſaid to <hi>Francion,</hi> I am conſident that your Conſcience is clear of the Crime which is impoſed on you. Yes (replyed <hi>Francion</hi>) I dare aſſure you that there is no ſuch thing, and howſoever it be carried, it muſt needs be ſome ſcandalous inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59287:155"/>but it moves not me at all, for I am above all theſe aſſaults.</p>
            <p>They had ſome other Diſcourſe on this ſubject, and afterwards they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to go to their repoſe: The next morning
<hi>Francion</hi> would wait upon <hi>Nays</hi> to give her a good morrow, but thinking to enter into her Houſe with that liberty which he thought did belong unto him, one of the Servants came to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him, that <hi>Nays</hi> was not yet ready. He ſtayed therefore ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, of his own accord, but believed, whatſoever the Cuſtoms of the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were, that he might be permitted to come unto her, if ſhe were but half ready, conſidering the Condition in which he was; and having a little time continued in this Patience, he attempted to go up the Stairs again; but it was told him, That on that day <hi>Nays</hi> was not diſpoſed to ſee any one.
<hi>Francion</hi> replyed, I believe you do not know me, honeſt Friend, or at leaſt you pretend that you do not know me. If <hi>Nays</hi> ſhould give order that no Man ſhould have acceſſe unto her, I believe I ought to be excepted. Tell her therefore It is I who am here, and ask her, If ſhe cannot make a diſtinction betwixt me and others. The Meſſenger made haſt to perform the Command, and there came one of her Pages from her, to acquaint him from his Miſtreſſe, That on that day ſhe would neither ſpeak with him, nor any one elſe, but for the dayes following, it might be ſhe would admit ſome others to ſpeak unto her, but not himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion</hi> was ſo moved to underſtand this anſwer, that he could willingly with his Cane have corrected the young Man for his ſawcineſſe, were it not for the reſpect which he did bear to the Livery, and the Colours of his Miſtreſs. At the firſt he perſwaded himſelf that this Anſwer proceeded from the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this malicious Servant, but afterwards he concluded that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been ſo unadviſed as to bring ſuch an anſwer to him, if he had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Commandment expreſly for it. Believing therefore that this Anſwer came from
<hi>Nays,</hi> he could not find the Cauſe of this ſo ſudden an alteration. He asked thoſe who were with him, What they conceived ſhould be the reaſon of this denyal; but they could not render him any ſatisfaction to his demands. Sometimes he repreſented to himſelf, that it was altogether impoſſible that <hi>Nays</hi> ſhould ſo undervalue him, and that all this was but a Device to ſolace her ſelf a little; and he thus diſcourſed with himſelf thereon, If it were a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſade which my Miſtreſſe is pleaſed to give me, I ſhall give her a greater oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to laugh at me, if I ſhould return without ſeeing her, as having too great an apprehenſion to diſpleaſe her; ſo that it would be better to uſe violence, and enter with confidence into the place where ſhe is, for all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements of her Servants; for although ſhe ſhould be a little angry, I know how to appeaſe her, and the contract for our Marriage being already paſſed, I am confident I may be well allowed to aſſume that liberty But on the contrary, if it be true that ſhe doth diſdain me, and that ſhe already repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth what but yeſterday ſhe did, to what purpoſe ſhould I go unto her? would it not cauſe her choler to increaſe againſt me? And were it not better to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed more gently on this affair?</p>
            <p>The Spirit of <hi>Francion</hi> was hereupon in a great Incertainty, and ſometimes he would conclude with himſelf, that it was no eaſie thing to put up this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, and if ſhame had not diſwaded him, he would have forced his way to the ſight of <hi>Nays,</hi> but he conſidered with himſelf, that if he could not then ſee her for all the violence he ſhould uſe, ſhe would but laugh at him the more: ſo that, at the laſt he concluded, that it was better to uſe ſome artifice, and to diſſemble that the Meſſage ſent unto him did not much diſpleaſe him, and to return without the leaſt noiſe. Having better thought upon it, he ſaid unto ſome of the Servants who were then about him, I muſt profeſſe unto you (ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Friends) that I have but a Treacherous Memory, I had quite forgot that <hi>Nays</hi> yeſterday did tell me, that ſhe deſired I ſhould not this day take the <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59287:156"/>pains to come unto her; but the Impatience of my affection is the Cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Having ſpoke that, he did go away chearfully to outward apparence, but ſo inwardly afflicted, that he hardly could expreſſe unto <hi>Raymond</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity he received. He ſaid, It made but ill for him on whatſoever ſide it was, for if it were true that <hi>Nays</hi> did undervalue him, the ſhame thereof would redound unto himſelf more than unto her, but if ſhe were pleaſed to make ſome mirth thereat, it was alſo very diſadvantagious to him, having deſerved to be uſed more honourably; And if the affairs had not been paſſed ſo far in the way of marriage, it were not ſo difficult to provide a remedy, but they had ſo far advanced themſelves, that he could not now diſingage with honour. <hi>Raymond</hi> did remonſtrate to him, that he ought not to trouble his Spirit with ſo many ſuppoſitions, without knowing what was the true cauſe which gave this diſtaſt to <hi>Nays,</hi> for the effecting whereof, he ought, he ſaid, to have recourſe to <hi>Dorini,</hi> or ſome other of the Kinred of
<hi>Nay. Francion</hi> replyed thereunto, that it did moſt of all afflict him, to ſee that his Fortune was ſo ſuddenly changed, when he thought it was the moſt eſtabliſhed, and he believed that for the time to come every one would laugh at him, and by turns make him the Ladder for their mirth to climb upon, as <hi>Bergamin</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready had begun to do. <hi>Raymond</hi> conſidering this adventure, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with that which before arrived to him, he conceived that the one might well have relation to the other; wherefore he deſired him freely to declare unto him how <hi>Bergamin</hi> came to enter into ſuch a familiarity with him, as to know the courſe of his moſt private affaires, and what was the ground thereof, when he ſaid, that he had made a promiſe to marry <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) that amongſt friends, ſuch as we are, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be concealed, and how can you give me Counſell in my affairs, if you are not entirely acquainted with them? A Phyſician can preſcribe no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt unto his Patient, without firſt he be acquainted with his Diſeaſe. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a fault yeſterday to ſpeak thereof too ſparingly unto you. It was a Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, I muſt confeſs, againſt the laws of my Duty, but you will hold me excuſable, if you will conſider that it proceeded rather from a ſhame, which did detain my words, than from any defect in my affection. I of a truth therefore doe declare unto you, that having received the aſſurances of the good will which
<hi>Nays</hi> did bear unto me, and having made many oathes and proteſtations to her, that I did know not any one more beautifull, and found nothing in the world more agreeable than herſelf, I had no longer the curioſity to look after other beauties which before I eſteemed; But wherefore ſhould this Lady ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe over me ſo tyrannical a power, as to have my eyes blinded from behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any other objects? Hath not Nature ordained ſight and Judgement unto men, to contemplate, and to admire all the beauties in the world? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the Queen of all other Cities, I ſhould ſhew my ſelf to have but little Spirit, If I ſhould not obſerve if the Ladies are not more beautifull here than in any other place. As for the Courtiſans, we may ſee them eaſily enough, but for civil and virtuous women it is very difficult, and this difficulty doth augment the deſire, and renders the pleaſure more great when we arrive to the height of our deſign. I have uſed my utmoſt endeavour to ſee ſome of them, both in their Churches, and in the places where they are accuſtomed to walk, and ſometimes they have not been ſo well veiled, but I have contemplated their beauties; but amongſt all thoſe whom I have ſeen, there is none ſo beautifull as <hi>Emilia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since my firſt comming unto <hi>Rome</hi> I have converſed with ſome <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen, amongſt whom I alwayes found this
<hi>Bergamin,</hi> who was moſt familiar with thoſe of them who were moſt debauched, and given to the greateſt expences. His gallantries did ſo much pleaſe me, that I deſired him, <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59287:156"/>That we might often ſee one another, and he himſelf, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, did not fail to give me many viſits. One morning he made his addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to me, as I was comming out of the Church, and he did me the favour to conduct me to another, where I beheld two Ladies, one of them ſeemed to ſtoop under the burden of Age, and the other, whom I conceived to be her Daughter, was one of the beſt featured, and the moſt beautifull that poſſibly could be ſeen. I ſuppoſed with my ſelf, That <hi>Bergamin</hi> had ſuch Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in <hi>Rome,</hi> that he could tell me who they were; but at that time he was unable to inform me; for this City is ſo peopled, that hardly one Neighbour knoweth another, howſoever he aſſur'd me, that in a very ſhort time he would ſatisfie my Deſires. I requeſted him to have me in his remembrance; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Ladies were going from the Church towards their own Lodgings, he counſelled me to ſtand ſtill a while, and he would follow them, to ſee into what Houſe they entred. He ſtayed three quarters of an hour, which ſeemed very tedious to me, and I was even about to be gone, believing that he had loſt his way. At the laſt he returned, and aſſured me, That thoſe two Ladies had their Lodgings cloſe unto that Church, and ſhewed me the Houſe; but the reaſon, he ſaid, wherefore he ſtaid ſo long, was, becauſe that hard by he had met with a Gentleman whoſe company was of great conſequence for the knowing of that which I ſo much deſired. He told me, that he was the Man who was imployed in the managing of all their affairs, and that at that preſent they were intricately moleſted in a great Sute at Law, having been inforced to forſake
<hi>Venice,</hi> their Native Country, to come to <hi>Rome</hi> to follow their Cauſe. He told me, that the Husband of <hi>Lucinda,</hi> who was the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Emilia,</hi> had commenced a Proceſſe againſt a Gentleman of
<hi>Rome,</hi> who deſpairing of his Cauſe, had recourſe to Violence, and treacherouſly killed him; whereupon the Widdow and her Daughter were come to
<hi>Rome</hi> to demand Juſtice on the Offender. When I underſtood this, I demanded, If the Sollicitor were not of power to bring me to the ſight of the Ladies? <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamin</hi> replied, It would be unneceſſary, I do conceive, at this time to propound that queſtion to him. When I underſtood that the Name of the old Lady was <hi>Lucinda,</hi> I immediately changed the Scene of my Diſcourſe, and did bias it another way; I aſſured him, That when I demanded of him who thoſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were, it was out of a curioſity of Indifferency, and not out of any vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence of affection. We <hi>Italians</hi> (ſaid <hi>Bergamin</hi>) are prone to jealouſie, and far from that Liberty which you <hi>Frenchmen</hi> do profeſſe; But becauſe the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor, whoſe Name is <hi>Salviati,</hi> is of a ſociable diſpoſition, I promiſe you I will take the opportunity to be more familiar with him.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoke this, <hi>Bergamin</hi> did withdraw himſelf, to go to Dinner to a Signior who had that morning invited him. The next morning he came to me again, and told me, That he had another conference with
<hi>Salviati,</hi> and that he had ſpoken to him of me, and aſſured him, that although I was a Stranger, yet my Condition and Deſerts did render me moſt eſteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Great Ones, inſomuch that I was very capable to aſſiſt thoſe who were in Diſtreſſe; and that having heard of the Diſaſter which had befallen the Houſe of <hi>Lucinda,</hi> I had pity of her, and wiſhed that it might lie in my power to do her any ſervice. He therefore adviſed him to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe himſelf to me, and to give me a particular account of the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for he ſaid I was throughly experienced in the affairs of Law: But as for the manner of the Death of
<hi>Fabius,</hi> the Husband of <hi>Lucinda,</hi> he ſaid, It were better if I would be pleaſed to take the pains to ſpeak with her my ſelf. I promiſed him (ſaid <hi>Bergamin</hi>) to acquaint you with it, and behold how all things do ſucceed according to your Deſire? Hereupon I did embrace
<hi>Bergamin,</hi> being tranſported with a great joy, that I had found the means to be acquainted with <hi>Lucinda. Bergamin</hi> ſaid unto me, But ſtay a little, we <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59287:157"/>muſt be wiſe, and uſe precautions in this buſineſſe; I can ſpeak to <hi>Salviati</hi> of
<hi>Lucinda,</hi> becauſe ſhe is antient, and therefore not to be ſuſpected, but I know not how to make mention to him of her Daughter. With much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty I have learned that her Name is <hi>Emilia.</hi> I replyed to him, Let me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone with it, I will deport my ſelf according to the
<hi>Italian</hi> humor; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have given ſuch a good report to
<hi>Salviati</hi> of me, I will be carefull that you ſhall not therein be found a Lyar. <hi>Bergamin,</hi> having continued with me a little while after this Diſcourſe, did repair into the City, and aſſured me that he would bring <hi>Salviati</hi> along with him; I was unwilling that he ſhould come unto my own Lodging, becauſe of the great numbers of <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen who conſtantly came to viſit me. I was at that time, brave
<hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> lodged in the ſame Houſe with you, and, I will not diſſemble with you, it was from you from whom moſt preciſely I would conceal my ſelf. I thought, if you had underſtood of my dealings and practices with the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> you would have ſuſpected ſomething, and hindred my Deſign. Oh no, ſaid <hi>Raymond,</hi> To believe that, were to doubt of my affection. You knew, replyed
<hi>Francion,</hi> It was at the ſame time when I was courting of
<hi>Nays,</hi> and that was one of the Reaſons why I did conceal it from you. What? ſaid <hi>Raymond,</hi> Do you take me to be an Enemy unto Nature? Since you are not yet poſſeſſed of <hi>Nays,</hi> Why ſhall it not be permitted to you to court ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Nay, Suppoſe that you had been married to her, you would not be the firſt to whom Love hath given paſſions to inthrall your ſelf to another Beauty. Let us live together as we have been accuſtomed; there is nothing that ſhould diſſwade you from declaring your Secrets unto me. So, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> We ſhould be guilty of one anothers Debauchments; Give me leave to tell you, There are ſome things which even Shame doth forbid us to declare unto our Friends, and they ought not to be offended if they do not reveal them; for, if they be but Indifferences proceeding from Female cauſes, it will no wayes diminiſh Friendſhip to conceal them. But to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect my adventure, I muſt acquaint you, That I deſired <hi>Bergamin</hi> to bring <hi>Salviati</hi> with him to a Church where I would be walking. <hi>Bergamin</hi> did applaud the counſel, for that, ſaid he, would be as if by accident we did meet with you, and I will not acquaint him, that you are waiting there in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of him. In this manner it was carried; and although I perceived that <hi>Salviati</hi> did put on a grave and a reſerved Countenance, I with many Complements did invite them both to Dine with me. <hi>Salviati</hi> ſeemed to be very unwilling, and ceremonious; but <hi>Bergamin</hi> overcame his reſiſtances, and we did go together into an Ordinary where we might be accommodated at what rate we pleaſed. There we did enter into a perfect acquaintance, and
<hi>Bergamin</hi> taking an occaſion to ſpeak of <hi>Lucinda,</hi> did openly profeſſe that I might be very helpfull to her. Sir, you ſhall then perform a great work of Charity (ſaid <hi>Salviati</hi>) ſhe is a Widdow, without Friends, and without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. She knows not any one in
<hi>Rome,</hi> except my ſelf, who have a long time dwelled in
<hi>Venice;</hi> but all that I can do is but to follow the Law for her, having no countenance at all from the great Officers of Iuſtice. I could wiſh that ſhe might be ſo happy as to find one that may aſſiſt her, not only for the good will I do bear unto her, but alſo for my own conſideration; for the compaſſion which I have had on her Misfortunes, hath ingaged me in certain round Sums of moneys unto divers Merchants, which I know not how to return, if her Sute in Law doth not find a happy event. I replyed to him, That
<hi>I</hi> was acquainted with ſome Cardinals of the greateſt power, with whom I had been familiar at <hi>Paris,</hi> before they arrived to that height of Dignity; and having ſaluted them ſince my comming to <hi>Rome,</hi> they ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly intertained me, that I believe they will not deny any civil courteſie which I ſhall demand of them. He made anſwer, That in truth it is daily obſerved, <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59287:157"/>that thoſe great Perſonages do render themſelves more eaſie and favourable to Strangers, than to thoſe of their own Nation; for they undervalue thoſe whom they ſee every day, and in obliging thoſe who are Foreiners, they do hope, it will render their courteſy, and their renown, more glorious. Thoſe words were not acceptable unto me, for they tended not to cauſe me to underſtand, that if I were high in the favour of the Great Ones, it was for ſome eminent Deſerts with which they ſaw me to be indued. I looked on him as a blunt Fellow, who knew not what did belong to the Civilities of a Courtier, and becauſe they ſhould not entertain a baſe opinion of me, I gave them to underſtand, That it was not my Cuſtom to Dine in ſuch places as where I then was, but only at that time I did inforce my ſelf unto it, that more freely I might enjoy their Company. Speaking thoſe words, they both ſtooped, and made many Reverences unto me, and having both expreſſed their thankfull obligations,
<hi>Salviati</hi> ſaid unto me, That if I would take the pains to give a viſit to <hi>Lucinda</hi> that afternoon, ſhe would take it for a great honor, and receiving the particulars of her Cauſe from her own mouth, I ſhould be the better able to inform them to whom the greateſt places in the Seats of Juſtice did belong. I was raviſhed to hear this Propoſition, hoping that I ſhould have the happineſſe to ſee <hi>Emilia</hi> alſo, although he made not the leaſt mention of her. <hi>Bergamin</hi> knowing that his preſence was unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, did willingly leave us, and accompanied with <hi>Salviati,</hi> I came to the Houſe of <hi>Lucinda;</hi> It was but a little one, but commodious enough for a Widdow-woman, who lived alone in it.
<hi>Salviati</hi> entred into it as freely as if it had been his own, and we found <hi>Lucinda</hi> in the Hall, and her Daughter <hi>Emilia</hi> with her. I muſt proteſt unto you, that I never did behold a more delicat crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; I faſtned my eyes upon her, but as ſoon as ſhe perceived it, ſhe did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire her ſelf into the Parlor. <hi>Salviati</hi> repreſented to
<hi>Lucinda,</hi> that I was the Man of whom in the morning he had made mention to her, and that he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped I ſhould be very profitable for the advancement of her Affairs. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me with very civil complements; for ſhe was a Woman of a gallant Spirit and Behaviour, and was lovely enough, being not ſo old as the weeds of her Widdowhood did make her to appear. Having related to me all along the proceedings of her Husband againſt one called
<hi>Toſtat,</hi> who deteined a great part of his Eſtate from him, ſhe told me alſo how he was killed as he was travelling from <hi>Venice</hi> unto
<hi>Padua,</hi> and that the ſaid <hi>Toſtat</hi> being apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, ſhe came to <hi>Rome</hi> to follow the Law againſt him, and hoped, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condemned to Death, ſhe ſhould have great Damages and Intereſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded her. I repeated to her the promiſes which I had made to her Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor; but I proteſt unto you, I had much to do to remember the words ſhe ſpake, ſo much was my Spirit diverted by the Beauties of
<hi>Emilia,</hi> I could not but curſe the Cuſtom of the <hi>Italians,</hi> which do not allow us the civil liberty to look on their Wives or Daughters. At the laſt it ſo happily did fall out, that <hi>Lucinda</hi> did begin to talk of her, which was a great comfort to me. She ſaid, That ſhe did not much care for any great Dammages the Law ſhould give her, for ſhe had enough already to content her during her life, having but one Daughter, who was ſhortly to enter into a Religious Houſe, and to have no more to do with the goods of Fortune. I aſſumed the freedom to demand of her, If it were ſhe whom I ſaw when I firſt came into her Houſe? She told me Yes; and as I did repreſene unto her that there were ſome Men who would think themſelves moſt happy to have ſuch a Wife, She replyed, ſhe was deſcended of Honourable Parentage, but having not means enough to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her according to her Birth, the ſafeſt way ſhe could take with her, was to put her into a Nunnery. We maintained other Diſcourſe on this ſubject, and after that I conceived that I had ſtayed long enough, I took my leave of her: Being gone, I demanded of <hi>Salviati</hi> if in good earneſt
<hi>Emilia</hi> was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59287:158"/>to confine her ſelf unto a Cloiſter? He told me, Yes; and that ſhe only ſtayed for money to give unto the Prioreſs, which her Mother hoped to receive from the charity of well-affected people. For my ſelf, ſaid I, I ſhall be ready to aſſiſt her; but I ſhould be more glad my money ſhould ſerve to marry her, than to retire her from the world. He laughed at thoſe words, and we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed afterwards of her Beauty, and her Merit. I muſt confeſſe unto you, that having ſeen her, I was the more incited to do ſomething for her Mother, and I endeavoured what lay in my power that ſhe might gain her Proceſſe, to the end that ſhe might have wherewith to marry her Daughter according to her Condition and Degree.</p>
            <p>I took my leave of <hi>Salviati,</hi> and viſited all thoſe one after another whom I conceived to be capable to aſsiſt
<hi>Lucinda.</hi> After the end of two days I returned to her, to give her an account of what <hi>I</hi> had done. She thanked me moſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, and told me, That ſhe ſhould confeſſe her ſelf to be much obliged to me all the dayes of her life. We were then alone in the Hall, when behold
<hi>Emilia</hi> came in. She ſeemed to be ſomething abaſhed to behold me, and made as though ſhe would return from whence ſhe came; but her Mother did command her to ſtay, which was indeed a very acceptable recompence for the pains I had taken. I parlyed to her with that diſcretion which is practiſed in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and I did not praiſe her but very modeſtly. Nevertheleſſe I made it appear, that ſhe had touched me within my heart, and that I much deſired to have ſuch a Miſtreſſe. I ſtayed with her as long as poſsibly I could, and taking my leave, I promiſed her Mother that I would viſit ſome other Lords on her behalf, which I performed with extraordinary care. I muſt confeſſe that <hi>Nays</hi> is beautifull, but
<hi>Emilia</hi> hath ſuch attractions, that when I ſee not <hi>Nays,</hi> I cannot but contemplate on <hi>Emilia.</hi> I no longer did content my ſelf with my antient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, I had rather have perpetually entertained my ſelf with this, if it had been poſsible for me; but I found I could not arrive unto it but by marriage only. To marry <hi>Emilia</hi> was not pleaſing to me, ſhe having no other riches but what were grounded on a Proceſſe, which might be as well loſt as gained. Nevertheleſſe I deliberated with my ſelf, that if I would receive any Pleaſure from her, it muſt be by the pretence of Marriage; ſo that oftentimes I diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with
<hi>Salviati</hi> concerning her, and told him, that he muſt not give way unto her to enter into a Relligious houſe; that it was no true Devotion that did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her to it, but her Mothers, and her own Ambition, becauſe for the preſent ſhe had not wealth enough to Marry her according to her Condition: She was endued, I ſaid, with ſuch perfections, that divers perſons of quality would take her freely, without demanding any Dowry but her Vertue. I in that manner did ſo diſcover my ſelf unto him, that he perceived. I did ſpeak of my ſelf, of which he was very glad, and I believe did advertiſe <hi>Lucinda</hi> of it. But becauſe I could not ſee her every time I did go to her Mothers houſe, and could not ſpeak aloud unto her before her Mother, it did much afflict me, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſpeak freely to young Gentlewomen, after the Manner of the <hi>French.</hi> I could not expreſſe my Love unto her, nothing did ſpeak but my eies only; but in this Country of <hi>Italy,</hi> but one glance, or little action, will often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpeak more to purpoſe, than all the long entertainments of other Nations. I could not be ſatisfied with that, and was therefore reſolved to write unto her, and to deſire <hi>Salviati</hi> to deliver my Letters. To write unto her a Letter of Love ſeemed to be too bold, and too difficult an enterprize for the firſt time, I only compoſed a Diſcourſe, where I introduced a Shepherd complaining, that he could not diſcover his paſsion to his Shepherdeſs; This was as a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, which did not addreſſe it ſelf unto any one in particular, and having ſhewed it to <hi>Salviati,</hi> he promiſed me to find out a way that <hi>Emilia</hi> ſhould have a ſight of it, although ſhe had taken an Oath not to peruſe any thing at all which did not ſpeak of Devotion; for in things which are excellent to the <pb facs="tcp:59287:158"/> world, we look not ſo much on the Subject as the Beauty of the Piece. I uſed all my Art and Induſtry, and did write it in <hi>Italian,</hi> with the help of a Poet of this City, who corrected the faults which I made; for having been reſident here but a ſhort time, I have not yet the propriety of the language. My Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor of Love, rather than of Law, did on the next morning inform me, that my Letter was very pleaſing to <hi>Emilia,</hi> ſo that I took the confidence to write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her two or three Letters of Love one after the other, which this man did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willingly deliver for me; We now called one another Coſins, and
<hi>Bergamin</hi> had ſpoken ſo well of me, that with what he himſelf obſerved in me, he was wonderfully incited to ſerve me; Nay, he did more, he procured me an anſwer from <hi>Emilia:</hi> It was a ſhort one indeed, but very favourable, and ſuch a one as I my ſelf could have wiſhed. The fair <hi>Emilia</hi> did permit that on that Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning I ſhould give her a Viſit, her Mother being in Bed, by reaſon of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition of her Body. I failed not to wait upon her, according to her dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, without fearing what might arrive; I found the Door of the Houſe only put to, and not latched, I therefore entred into the Hall, where <hi>Emilia</hi> did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend my comming, having with her no light but that of the Moon, who dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her beams into a little window, the Caſement whereof was open. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon had light enough to diſcover that I was not deceived, and that I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me that wonderfull Beauty; I would have thanked her for the favour ſhe had done me, in the faireſt words I could expreſſe; but ſhe aſſured me, that I muſt be thankfull only to my own importunity, which had overcome her to permit me to come unto her, to underſtand what was the Subject of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. I made anſwer to her, That the greateſt happineſſe that poſſibly could arrive unto me, was to ſee her, by what means ſoever it could be effected, but ſhe ought not therefore to reject the Obligation which I pretended to her Beauties. By little and little I entred into Diſcourſe with her, and made her more ſenſible of my paſsion by my Tongue, than I had done before by my Pen. I diſcourſed with her of the Deſign ſhe had to enter into a Religious Houſe. She told me, That the ſame deſire continued with her, for ſhe believed that no Man would be ſo deſperat, as to marry a Maid ſo unfortunate as her ſelf. I will deny nothing to you, brave <hi>Raymond,</hi> I made anſwer to her, That ſhe a Thouſand times ſurpaſſed a number of thoſe Ladies who had a more proſperous Fortune; and if ſhe would vouchſafe to love me, I would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to put a Period to her Misfortunes, and to render her the happieſt, and moſt contented Creature in the World. I did ſpeak unto her in theſe very terms, and added not one ſyllable more unto them; and ſhe conceiving to her ſelf that I had made a promiſe of Marriage to her, did ſwear unto me faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to recompence my affection. I kiſſed her hands, and her naked arms, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as I pleaſed, but I touched not her lip but only once. I had a deſire to have uſed all my force in ſome other place; for we who are true Warriers do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand well enough, that ſome Forts are more eaſie to be taken in one corner than another; I did attempt to feel her Breſts, &amp; three or four times I obtained what I deſired. I had a violent deſire to paſs further, and at that inſtant to have enjoyed all that I could hope for; for in Love we muſt take all that we can while Fortune ſmileth upon us. It is Diſcretion to take, and to make uſe of that to day, which we do not know whether we may have to morrow or not: But I perceived that I fell far ſhort of my Account. She aſſured me, That ſhe would never ſee me more, if
<hi>I</hi> would not demean my ſelf more civilly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her; and that I ought to content my ſelf with the hazard, into which for my ſake ſhe had put her ſelf, which, if it were known, would be enough to diſhonor her for ever. I would not force her; for I believed it would be unprofitable; and when ſhe made me to underſtand that it was time for her to retire, I departed as contentedly as I came unto her; and of Neceſsity it muſt be, that they were all faſt aſleep within, or that the Men and Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervants
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59287:159"/>were of the Plot with her; for I heard not the leaſt noiſe at all. I would not diſcover unto <hi>Salviati</hi> that I had been with her; It was ſufficient for me to be happy, without making others acquainted with it. He did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that I was beloved by <hi>Emilia,</hi> having delivered into my hand a Letter from her; but I did not open it before him, becauſe I would not ſhew him the Contents thereof. Nevertheleſſe he freely declared himſelf, that he doubted not but that the moſt beautifull Maid had a deſire to witneſſe to me all ſort of affections, in the recompence of my own, becauſe ſhe was extraordinary glad to have found a Perſon of Honour that would marrie her, and maintain her in the world, having no mind unto the Cloyſter, but only in caſe of neceſſity. I made no anſwer to him, but only in obſcure terms; to the end that he might interpret them as he himſelf pleaſed. Howſoever I hoped that by this means at laſt I ſhould be able to ſatisfie my love. I did write again unto <hi>Emilia,</hi> and I received an anſwer which did permit me to give her a Second Viſit, but I did no more than at the firſt time. She ſeemed to be much incenſed againſt my violence, and told me, That I did uſe her far more uncivilly than I ought; and, if my affection were ſo impatient, I ſhould demand her in marriage of her Mother. I did demonſtrate to her, that I was a Strange, and although I had large poſſeſſions, I could not be ſo well accommodated, as is a Man in his own Country; That before I thought of Marriage, I ought to put my ſelf into a condition to ſupport the Charges of it, it being a buſineſſe of that conſequence, that I ſhould acquaint my Kinred with it. She replyed to me, That if I had loved accordingly as I ſaid, I would ask no counſel, but of Love only; and as for Wealth, I had enough where I was to content her. I believe ſhe did perceive that I had an Intent to have deceived her; for after that time ſhe entertained me with no more favourable Language, ſo that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly I did depart from her. I afterwards did write three Letters unto her, to which ſhe returned but one Anſwer, in which ſhe accuſed me of treachery and ingratitude. For all that, I continued to come unto her Mothers Houſe, but I did ſee her Daughter but ſeldom, or if I had ſeen her, it was without ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to her. I only conferred with her Mother, to be informed of the time in which I was to make my moſt powerfull Sollicitations on her behalf; but <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viati</hi> did repreſent unto us, That by reaſon of the crafty proceedings of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Party, a Demurre was made in the hearing of her Canſe. When I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived there was no hope to gain what I deſired of
<hi>Emilia,</hi> I did not with ſuch heat follow the Sute; and becauſe at that time alſo I courted <hi>Nays,</hi> who daily did increaſe her affections towards me, I only ſerved her, and doubled my attendance on her. At that time the learned <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> by his gallantries, did cauſe us to paſſe away our time in laughter, which brought ſome eaſe to the impatiency of my Spirit. <hi>Salviati</hi> once or twice demanded of me, How I thrived in my Loves? And what was the reaſon that I was ſo rare a Gueſt at <hi>Lucindaes</hi> houſe? But I coldly replyed, That I was afraid to appear too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate. I believe he perceived well enough that I had a thorough change wrought upon me; but becauſe he did ſpeak no more unto me, I alſo did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to eſchew his Company, as much as poſſibly I could: and ſome time it is ſince I heard any mention made of
<hi>Emilia,</hi> until Signior <hi>Bergamin</hi> did now ſpeak of her. I made nothing of it, as you perceived; for what reaſon had I to yield unto that which he alleged. It may ſuffice that I have told you the truth of all, without augmentation or diminution, and you may now underſtand if
<hi>Emilia</hi> hath a juſt Cauſe to deſire any thing of me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion</hi> having thus finiſhed his Diſcourſe,
<hi>Raymond</hi> ſaid unto him, That if this in truth were all,
<hi>Emilia</hi> could not conſtrain him to any thing; but ſince ſhe had diſcovered her moſt ſecret affairs, which were made known to
<hi>Berga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> he ought to have a care of that <hi>Bergamin,</hi> who by his flouting Arts might make him ridiculous to the World. I know not what he will do, ſaid <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi> 
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59287:159"/>for <hi>Lucindaes</hi> and <hi>Emilias</hi> ſake, but I conceeive he came to the intelligence of it from <hi>Salviati.</hi> I believe they gave him this commiſſion to come unto me, being a man of a more apprehenſive Spirit, and of a more courtly preſence, than his friend. But howſoever it be, neither one nor the other of them have any cauſe at all to laugh at me. I have taken much pleaſure at the entertainment of <hi>Emilia,</hi> and can tell you ſomething elſe which is more than that, but that was not able to recompence my ſervice, for at that time I deſired nothing more than her preſence, and eſteemed it to be equal to the greateſt happineſſe which the world could afford. It may be alleged, it hath coſt me ſomething, it may be ſo, but it is ſo little, that it is not conſiderable. <hi>Salviati</hi> taking notice one time that I was buying ſo many yards of <hi>Genoa</hi> Sattin as would make me a compleat ſuit, did tell me, that he would alſo buy ſome of the ſame piece, to make him a Doublet, which he would wear with a pair of Breeches of
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> cloath. He took ſome of the ſame, and ſuffered me to pay for his Sattin with my own. In the ſame manner he ſometimes alſo ſollicited my liberality, and his Camrade was not wanting in the ſame invention, but becauſe they had done ſome courteſies for me, I did not refuſe to be aſſiſting to them. To what end do riches ſerve but for honourable expences? You have reaſon ſo to ſay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<hi>Raymond,</hi> we muſt have pity on thoſe honeſt fellows, whoſe imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is to make us merry. Men are made to be helpfull one to another; and for ſuch Drols as theſe, they could not live if it were not for ſuch perſons as our ſelves. But if <hi>Bergamin</hi> ſhall come again, I would adviſe you not to deſpiſe his Remonſtrances; It were better to gain him by mildneſſe (which I believe is an eaſie thing to doe) that ſo you may me be aſſured of him, and the management of your loves may be concealed.</p>
            <p>As they were in this communication, <hi>Dorini</hi> came to ſee them, and turning to <hi>Francion,</hi> he told him, that all was ſpoiled, and that <hi>Nays</hi> was in ſuch a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt him, that ſhe could not be appeaſed. Her love, he ſaid, was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into hatred, and ſhe would break whatſoever had paſſed betwixt them, and had ſworn to the performance of it. Are you in good earneſt, ſaid <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi> and is it by her expreſſe commandement that I muſt come no more unto her? It is a reſolution unworthy of her, and I deſerve not to be ſo rejected.
<hi>Dorini</hi> made anſwer, But obſerve the reaſons of my Kinſwoman, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declare unto you what moſt unfortunately hath happened. Yeſterday late in the Evening there came two Ladies to her houſe, who deſired to ſpeak with her, one of them was called <hi>Lucinda,</hi> and the other was her Daughter <hi>Emilia,</hi> they are both of <hi>Venice,</hi> and are come to
<hi>Rome</hi> to follow a ſute of Law. <hi>Nays</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that they addreſſed themſelves unto her to ſollicite ſome friends of hers on their behalf, as ſhe hath ſome Kinſmen who ſit in the chief ſeats of Juſtice, ſhe therefore commanded that they ſhould come in, being extremely charitable to all of her ſex; But ſhe heard another buſineſſe, quite contrary to that which ſhe expected.
<hi>Francions</hi> heart began to pant at this word of <hi>Emilia,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready did ſuſpect his miſ-fortune; which when <hi>Dorini</hi> perceived, he thus continued his diſcourſe. <hi>Lucinda</hi> having taken
<hi>Nays</hi> aſide, did repreſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, that ſhe was very ſorry that ſhe no ſooner underſtood what had paſſed betwixt you and her, but at the firſt intelligence ſhe made all the haſt ſhe could to forbid the Banes, and to declare unto her, that you had promiſed mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to her Daughter. Howſoever ſhe hoped that the affair was not ſo far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, but that a remedy might be yet appled, and that <hi>Nays</hi> had underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding enough not to be married to ſuch a man, who having contracted himſelf to another Lady, had ſo manifeſtly abuſed both of them. <hi>Nays</hi> had a good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of theſe two Ladies, who were accounted to be honeſt and honourable, and ſhe made no doubt but that their allegations were true. At the laſt <hi>Emilia</hi> produced a Letter which you had wrote unto her, by which <hi>Nays</hi> moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently did perceive, that you were moſt paſſionately inamoured on her. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59287:160"/>moreover did acquaint her, that you had ſeen her Daughter alone, and that you then had promiſed to eſpouſe her. This did wonderfully poſſeſſe <hi>Nays,</hi> and did exaſperate her againſt you, which at that time ſhe did not make apparent, for ſhe is a Woman of an admirable diſcretion, although ſhe cannot but with great impatience indure an affront. <hi>Emilia</hi> ſaid but little, but ſhe wept abundantly, as well for her own fault as for yours, being aſhamed that ſhe had ſo much obliged an ungratefull perſon to her; but her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did ſpeak for her, and related to <hi>Nays</hi> the good Entertainment which oftentimes ſhe had given you, in hope to have you her Son-in-Law, in which ſhe forgat the Cuſtom of her Country, where Men are not ſo freely entertained by Ladies, as in your own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nays</hi> ſeemed to be ſatisfied at the teſtimonies which ſhe had ſeen, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ſign of paſſion, aſſured <hi>Lucinda,</hi> that ſhe for her own part would no ways hinder your return to <hi>Emilia;</hi> and being convinced of your inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſhe was reſolved no more to eſteem of you, and not ſo much as once again to ſee you. With this aſſurance <hi>Lucinda</hi> and
<hi>Emilia</hi> departed, and <hi>Nays</hi> bringing them to her door, did thank them for the favor they had done her, in delivering her from the danger in which ſhe was ready to have involved her ſelf, by marrying a Man ſo perfidious as your ſelf. I believe ſhe did take but little reſt that night; for the day no ſooner appeared, but the unquietneſſe of her Spirit was ſo great, that ſhe ſent for me to come unto her, to acquaint me with theſe ungratefull tydings. I could not go ſo ſoon as I deſired, becauſe I was imployed in affairs of great importance; but comming to her at the laſt, ſhe related this unto me in a marvellous choler, and tranſportation of Spirit, and commanded me to deſire you to come no more unto her; for ſhe belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſhe ſhould be guilty of a great crime, if ſhe ſhould permit you to come within her Doors. When ſhe makes any mention of you, it is with theſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets of <hi>Perfidious,</hi> and
<hi>Ingratefull,</hi> and with the appellations of <hi>Traytor,</hi> and
<hi>Monster;</hi> and ſhe hath reſolved with her ſelf to make void whatſoever ſhe hath contracted with you. For my part, I know not what to ſay unto her, ſhe is very angry with me, and tels me that I am the cauſe of her Misfortune, having ſpoken better of you than you deſerved. I muſt confeſſe, to my own ſhame, that ſhe hath juſt reaſon to complain,
<hi>Emilia</hi> hath left with her one of her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which ſhe hath ſhewed unto me; and never take me to be the Man as I am, but to be without Eyes and Judgement, if I do not believe that you did write that Letter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion,</hi> having liſtned to him very attentively, ſaid, That he would never deny but that he had wrote Letters to
<hi>Emilia,</hi> and that he had often ſeen her; But (my brave
<hi>Dorini</hi>) ſaid he, Doe not you underſtand me better? Doe you think that I ceaſe to be what I have been, or that you are changed from what you were? Do you not know that we have alwayes lived in that liberty, which untill this hour you never did complain of? I know not for what cauſe you do ſpeak unto me with ſo much animoſity. <hi>Dorini</hi> did reply unto him, When I ſaw you firſt of all in <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Raymonds</hi> Caſtle, I was not moved at your irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and unconſtant affections, for you were then in the height of your Youth; but now you are to put on a more auſtere, and reſerved garb. I do profeſſe unto you, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> That now I am obliged ſo to do, ſince yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day I was contracted unto
<hi>Nays,</hi> and if hereafter I ſhall commit any wanton Act contrary to that obligation, I ſhall adjudge my ſelf to be extremely guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but at that time when I courted <hi>Emilia,</hi> I was not contracted unto
<hi>Nays.</hi> But why, replyed <hi>Dorini,</hi> Did you Court her with ſo much Paſſion, having profeſſed ſo much Service to my Kinſwoman? You had otherwiſe been excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, and we do believe that <hi>Emilia,</hi> in ſome Letters of yours, can ſhow your promiſe of Marriage under your own hand. Did ſhe ſhew any ſuch Letter unto <hi>Nays,</hi> ſaid
<hi>Francion?</hi> No, replyed <hi>Dorini,</hi> but ſhe believes ſhe hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59287:160"/>that Letter with an intent to ſhew it to the Iudge before whom you will be brought, which will make much againſt you. I proteſt unto you (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) ſhe hath no ſuch Letter. But for all that, replyed <hi>Dorini,</hi> We doe imagine that you had your pleaſure with her. You know (ſaid <hi>Francion</hi>) that I alwayes have been addicted to the pleaſures of Love; You may therefore believe I ſhould not have been ſorry to have enjoyed her, neither would I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it if I had done it; for ſometimes it is one part of the contentments of a Conqueror to ſing the glories of his Triumph. And, if it were ſo, I do believe ſhe could have no great Action againſt me; for the Iudges obſerving her light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be ſo ſoon ſurprized by a Stranger, would be prone to take my part, and to apptebend that ſhe had been before of a looſe Converſation: And <hi>Nays</hi> ought in reaſon to reject me for that, for we ſee no Man ſo ſenſleſs as to refuſe his good Fortune; but all this is but nothing, I am confident that I have not failed in any thing, and do not deſerve that rough uſage I have received. I will conceal nothing from you, but give you a full account of all that hath paſſed betwixt
<hi>Emilia</hi> and my ſelf.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Francion</hi> repeated the Hiſtory almoſt in the very ſame words as he told it before to <hi>Raymond,</hi> and <hi>Dorini</hi> profeſſed to him, that if there were nothing elſe, he in truth was not ſo faulty; but he ſhould find a very hard task to perſwade his Coſin to beleive it, who was a Woman entire in her reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and would abſolutely make all void that ſhe had contracted: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he promiſed <hi>Francion,</hi> that for his own part he would act nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. <hi>Raymond,</hi> who had a great power over, did intreat him not to fail in this promiſe to his Friend, and he would demand no other recompence for the great affection which he had alwayes born unto him. He aſſured him, that he would be favourable to him, and ſo took his leave of them both, being amazed at ſo ſudden, and ſo great a change.</p>
            <p>This did render <hi>Francion</hi> very melancholly, for he knew he could no where meet with a better Fortune than <hi>Nays;</hi> it did torment him to loſe her, and it did more torment him that he muſt loſe her with diſhonor; but <hi>Raymond</hi> did the beſt he could to draw him out of his amazement and affliction. He told him that he muſt put on a generous reſolution, and if he married not <hi>Nays,</hi> he might find every where Women enough, They, he ſaid, were a Common Merchandiſe, and it would not be for his advantage to abandon his Fortunes in <hi>France,</hi> to dwell in
<hi>Italy. Raymond</hi> ſpoke this on his own behalf, for it grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to loſe his Company, and to be inforced to return to <hi>France</hi> without him; ſo that, whatſoever he had ſpoke to the contrary, he had rather his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ſhould be broken off, than accompliſhed. <hi>Francion</hi> ſeemed in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to approve of what he ſaid, and they both conſented to go abroad, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to paſſe away their Diſcontents, for it was not yet Dinner time, and they had a deſire to hear Maſſe.</p>
            <p>They repaired to the next Church, where there were but few people, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs as they walked in the Cloiſters they were ſo preſſed with the Crowd, that they were amazed at it. At the laſt, as they entred into an obſcure Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>Francion</hi> felt a hand ſumbling in his Pocket. He was alwayes ſubtle and diligent, and immediatly did put his hand down to take hold of his who was tampering with his Pocket; but the Pick-pocket withdrew it ſo ſuddenly, that <hi>Francion</hi> miſſed of his intention. He immediatly cryed out, a Cut-purſe, a Cutpurſe, and commanded his Lackeys to purſue him; but he conveyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf away ſo cunningly, that they could not find him. <hi>Francion,</hi> having put his hand into his Pocket, did perceive that his money was ſtill there, inſomuch that he ſaid, That the ſlippery Companion had not the leiſure to finiſh his work; and that he ought to comfort himſelf; for if he had loſt his money, as he had loſt his Love, he had reaſon to ſay, that all the Misfortune in the world had happened to him on that day. After that, he heard Maſſe with
<hi>Raymond,</hi> and <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59287:161"/>as they came out the Church, they reſolved with themſelves to walk into the City. <hi>Francion,</hi> as he paſſed by them, found himſelf much importuned by the Tradeſmen, who perpetually demanded of him, What do you lack? What do you lack? which did begin to diſpleaſe him, and he always found ſome of thoſe men croſſing him in his way, whom he had obſerved at Maſſe, who were people but of a mean condition, and preſaged no good unto him. In the end he ſtayed at a perfumers ſhop, having a deſire to buy ſome Cyprian powder, and pulling his money out of his Pocket (for he never uſed a Purſe) be was much aſtoniſhed to find three times as much money in his Pocket as he had put into it, and that they were pieces of more value; he ſhewed them to
<hi>Raymond,</hi> and ſaid unto him, that he believed that the money did grow and multiply in his pocket, or elſe he muſt acknowledge, that at
<hi>Rome</hi> were the braveſt Cut-purſes in the world, who inſtead of taking away mens moneys, doe give them a great deal more than they had before; And if that this did ſo fall out on every day, he would let them dive into his Pocket as often as they pleaſed. The Cut-purſes of <hi>Paris</hi> were but knaves and bunglers, he ſaid, to the Cutpurſes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and had no ſuch Art that was ſo profitable to the people. <hi>Raymond</hi> made anſwer to him, That the Cut-purſes did politickly in it, to put in more money, for it was to charm thoſe Pockets they did intend to pick, that ſo having helped to fill them at firſt, they might empty them at laſt for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together. You ſpeak with good reaſon, ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> I believe this Pilferer would have done the ſame, or peradventure he conveyed in my Pocket the money which he ſtole from others, that I ſhould keep it for a time for him. See here his Quadruples which I never touched before; If this money be not preſently imployed, it will peradventure be of no profit to me, for it may be it was not well got, I will therefore find one ſpeedy way or other to lay it forth. As he ſpoke that, there approached to him four men, and one of the ſaid unto him, that he muſt give him an account where he had that money, and that was not all, for he told him that he had other things to lay unto his charge, whereupon he commanded the other three to apprehend him, and carry him away to priſon. <hi>Francion</hi> told him, that he had committed no fault at all, and <hi>Raymond</hi> with the Lackeys would have reſcued him, but there came in half a dozen Serjeants to ſecure the priſoner. There were alſo many Citizens, who walking up and down the ſtreets, would have been ready to have aſſiſted them, and moreover, a man ought to be moſt carefull in that well-governed City, for if he had affronted a Serjeant or his Yeoman, or any other officer, he ſhould be moſt ſeverely puniſhed, <hi>Raymond,</hi> having done what he could for his friend, without uſing any violence, was contented to goe along with him, but the Officers would not give way unto it, and he himſelf on matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer deliberation did believe, that being at liberty he ſhould be more ready to aſſiſt his friend in his neceſſities, and to draw him out of the calamity into which he was fallen. He knew not whether it was <hi>Nays</hi> that cauſed him to be arreſted. or <hi>Emilia,</hi> and he could not believe that either of them could be ſo cruell to him. In the mean time
<hi>Francion</hi> was with the Serjeants, who made it their firſt work to ſeize upon all his money. He intreated them not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace him, nor take hold of him as they lead him, which they would hardly condeſcend unto, for they were afrald that he being nimble of body would make an eſcape, although they had on every ſide incompaſſed him. They were a great way from any priſon, therefore fearing that in ſo long a way he might poſſibly find ſome friends to reſcue him, they brought him into the houſe of one of the Officers, who was commanded to have a ſpecial eye over him. They put all his money upon the Table, and having looked upon the Quadruples, they ſaid, that moſt aſſuredly they were counterfeit, and that he was one of thoſe who were the Coyners of falſe money. The ludge, having looked upon them, and made trial of them, ſaid, they were ſtark naught, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59287:161"/>for his further ſatisfaction, it was neceſſary to ſend for the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith to make tryal of them. When he came, he ſaid, he needed not to try them upon the Touchſtone, for they were of ſo baſe an alloy, that they were worth nothing at all. Howſoever, to obſerve the equal form of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in that nature, they inforced him to put practice the proofs of his art, whereupon he did cut one of the Quadruples in two pieces, and found it to be but ſlightly covered with gold on the outſide, and to be braſſe, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſophiſticated metal within. <hi>Francion</hi> was glad that he was accuſed of a thing, of which he was moſt intirely innocent, for at the firſt he feared that it was <hi>Emilia</hi> who had cauſed him to be arreſted, pretending that he had promiſed marriage to her, and that he had frequented her Company; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the affair had not ſo far advanced it ſelf as it might have been, yet ſhe might have given a ſiniſter interpretation of it to the Magiſtrates, and ſo far to have prevailed upon their compaſſion, as to have cauſed him to be taken Priſoner. But no mention of that was made at all, and becauſe he was only charged with the falſe pieces which were found in his hands, he told the Judge, there needed not ſo great an examination about it, nor ſo many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that if he had but ſteadfaſtly looked upon them himſelf, he ſhould have judged that they had not been worth any thing; he alleged they were none of his, and he knew not by what means they came into his Pocket, if ſome cheator or other had not cunningly put them in. O what an excuſe is this, ſaid the Serjeants, when was it ſeen that ever one man did ſteal his money into the Pockets of another? And why not ſo? replyed
<hi>Francion,</hi> you ſee that all my money is not falſe, and that there is ſome of a good alloy. And ſo it may be, ſaid one of the company, the good ſerveth to make the bad to paſſe, and it is likely you have received the good money in exchange of the bad, from ſome Merchant whom you have deceived.</p>
            <p>Hereupon his falſe accuſer did advance himſelf, and ſtanding up, he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Judge, You are to underſtand, that this man having coyned a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of falſe pieces, did diſtribute them to many, to whom he was ingaged, who bought many commodities with them up and down the City. One infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med me of it, who is an aſſociate of ſome perſons who do lend forth money, and did put even thoſe falſe pieces into the Bank, to make their deceitfull mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe the more current. <hi>Francion</hi> hereupon did take the word out of his mouth, and told him that he was a Knave, and an Impoſtor, and that he could not prove one word of what he ſpake; but his accuſer replyed to him, that when time ſhould ſerve he would ſhow the truth of his accuſation. This is not the firſt time ſaid he, that this man hath made it his trade to deceive all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; I ſhall declare unto you one of his deceipts, and one of the greateſt ones in the world; It is not long ſince he was in the City of <hi>Genoa,</hi> where he acted the part both of a Gentleman, and a Merchant, and took upon him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo diverſe other Trades. Being there, he pretended that he had received great ſums of money from diverſe perſons who were indebted to him, and he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from ſeveral Merchants above twenty pair of ſcales, and from all thoſe weights which were to weigh Piſtols, he clipped away a certain quantity; He then having gathered together many good Piſtols, did clip them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the proportion of the weights which he had clipped. He kept the ſcales but a little time with him, but returned them, that the Merchants might entertain no ſuſpition of him. Not long afterwards he did goe to the ſame Merchants, and with the clipped Piſtols did buy of them a great quantity of ſtuff; The Piſtols being weighed were found equal to the weight in the ſcales, which weight he before had clipped. The Merchants believing the Piſtols to be good weight, were well contented, and he departed to ſell his ſtuffs elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, having gained all the Gold which he had clipped off the Piſtols, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <pb n="17" facs="tcp:59287:162"/>he had made great profit, ſelling ſome part of it, and keeping the other to mingle it with his bad alloy, when he coyned falſe pieces, ſuch as were theſe which he had about him when he was apprehended, Some of the Merchants having afterwards good Piſtols to weigh, were amazed to ſee them much hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than the weights of their ordinary ſcales, and as they compared them with other weights, they perceived that the light weights were the ſame which came from that man. They communicated what had befallen them one unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and all of them remembring that their ſcales paſſed through the hands of this man, they perceived the cheat, and were reſolved to cauſe him to be puniſhed, if they could apprehend him. They could never ſince hear of him, for he doth nothing elſe but run from place to place, and change his name and habit; but now, ſince we have him in cuſtody, and I do perfectly remember that it is the ſame man, for I do call to mind that I have ſeen him in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, I doubt not but they will joyn with us in proſecuting the Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Conſider with your ſelves if there was ever a greater cheat, and if the French men be not more ſubtle than we can imagin. I know many other prancks that he hath played, which in due time and place I will diſcover to you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion</hi> was much aſtoniſhed at the impudence of this man, who did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute unto him things which he never thought of. He exclaimed againſt him, and proteſted that he was never at <hi>Genoa</hi> in his life, and that he would prove his life quite contrary to that which he alleged. He ſaid, he was a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of honourable parentage, and that he lived always in the Court of <hi>France</hi> near unto Princes and the greateſt Signiors, that there was not a French man in <hi>Rome</hi> but knew him, and could teſtifie the great eſteem in which he always lived. It is probable, ſaid his Accuſer, that the French men who are now in <hi>Rome</hi> will take his part, whether it be to preſerve the honour of their Nation, or that a great part of them have received much profit by him. It is ſufficiently known, that there are many young Gentlemen of great Families, who receive not ſo much money from their own Countries as they deſire. inſomuch that they are inforced to have recourſe to this Impoſtor, and to make him their laſt refuge, who lends them counterfeit moneys, hoping that one day when they are teturned into their own Country they will pay him back good for it, with intereſt, for he is not afraid to add uſury to the number of his other vices. Not long ago he ſeemed to take pleaſure to expreſs-himſelf very liberally to thoſe whom he perceived to be in want. He invited one night unto Supper all the brave Blades of this City, who had ruined themſelves and their Eſtates upon the Courtiſans; He entertained them with a magnificent Feaſt, in which was ſuch variety, that no leſſe than ſix Courſes one after the other were ſerved in upon the Table. In the firſt Courſe were meats to prepare, as well ſo ful of all manner of variety, that it ſeemed to ſurfeit as much the eye as the appetite. In the third Courſe were Tarts, Cuſtards, and Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines. In the fourth, all manner of raw fruits. In the fifth, Confects &amp; Suckets. But for the ſixth, it was extraordinary and wonderfull. He would be the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard himſelf, and did ſet a great Baſin full of Money on the Table; They belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at firſt that the Baſin was only full of water to waſh their hands, but they perceived it to be full of pieces of Gold, and looked one on another with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. He deſired every one of the Company to take as much thereof as he pleaſed. It is ſaid, my young Gallants were ſo modeſt, that he was fain to intreat them again; at the laſt every one took a handfull of the Gold. He deſired them, that they would be pleaſed to fall to it again, and to empty the Baſin; but he could not perſwade them to it; for they were aſhamed to ſhow themſelves ſo inſatiable, to a Man that was ſo prodigal. I have heard it ſpoken indeed, that theſe Gentlemen deſired, every one of them, to borrow money of <pb n="18" facs="tcp:59287:162"/>him, and he being uncertain what anſwer to give them, did at laſt reſolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this gallantry; When the Table-cloath was taken off, every one of them did put his Mony upon the Table, and counting it there, they did all promiſe to pay it back to him again, with Intereſt. He deſired them not to take care for that, and aſſured them, that he deſired no other profit of his money; but only the contentment to be ſtiled their Friend. It ſufficed him, he ſaid, if at any time without Intereſt they would return the Money again; for he knew well enough that he muſt ſtay long for it; and beſides he was in great danger to loſe it all, and it was to no purpoſe to demand Bonds of ſuch young gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, who had ſuch Parents, that they would never be induced to pay for their Childrens Debauchment. In this he acted the part of a magnificent Signior, and I know not if that great Pretender <hi>Bragad in,</hi> who hath been ſo famous in
<hi>Venice,</hi> did ever perform ſo noble an act, although he vaunteth that he hath found the Philoſophers ſtone, and can produce out of other metals ſo much Gold as he pleaſeth, by his Powder of Perfection. This Man alſo who ſtands there, would perſwade us to a belief, that to authoriſe his Prodigality he is the Maſter of the ſame Secret; but let him make it if he can, he may be ſure he ſhall have my good word no more than
<hi>Bragadin</hi> had, who being condemned for a Sorcerer, and an Impoſtor, was put to death in <hi>Germany,</hi> and, for ought that I know, this Man doth deſerve the ſame puniſhment. We are moreover to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the
<hi>French</hi> who are in this City ought not to be accepted as Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the behalf of this Offender; for the greateſt part of them are obliged to him, and have received from him remarkable courteſies. There are many things worthy your obſervation in that which I have ſpoken: for firſt of all, to lend, and give away ſo much money to ſuch a multitude of Men, and to live at ſo high a rate as he doth, (which may ſuffice a Princes Court) doth prove, that of Neceſſity he muſt drive ſome unlawfull Trade, which gives him the means ſtill to hold out, and to ſupply himſelf with ſo vaſt a bank of monies. You ought alſo to conſider his Cheats, and how he doth impoſe ſometimes on one, and ſometimes on another, and the great diſgrace and loſſe he brings to <hi>Italy,</hi> by making current thoſe pieces, which are either not weight, or alltoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther counterfeit. We may do well to look out ſome Novice lately come from <hi>France,</hi> who is not yet guilty of his Liberality, who freely may inform us, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he heard of him in
<hi>France,</hi> and if he be not a Counterfeit himſelf, and one who ought not to abuſe the name of a Gentleman, and we ſhall then perceive that it is an eaſie matter to be Liberal by falſe Merchandiſe. We ought alſo to apprehend ſome of his Servants, and ſtrictly to examine them, that we may be better informed in the ſecret of their Maſters affairs.</p>
            <p>The Iudge, who heard all this, commanded the Accuſer to be ſilent, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him aſide, told him, That he had done very ill ſo manifeſtly to diſcover theſe proceedings of Iuſtice. He did well to enjoyn him ſilence, for he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſuch a flux of words, that he did ſpeak all that which he did know, and all that which he did not know; and he could hardly be reſtrained, but would ſtill have accumulated more calumniations on him, which were all farr from the truth; for he imputed to
<hi>Francion</hi> alone whatſoever he had heard ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before of all the Mountebanks and Impoſtors that were ever ſeen in <hi>Italy. Francion,</hi> who found that this Information had not the leaſt apparence, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the affected paſſion in which his Accuſer did expreſſe himſelf, and the ſtrange poſtures and ill-favoured faces which he made, could hardly, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight, and midſt of his Misfortune, forbear from laughter. The Magiſtrate that was then preſent, and was a Man of ſome underſtanding, did give no great reſpect unto that Informer, but commanded him the ſecond time to hold his peace, and it being much about the time of Dinner, he ſaid he would have this buſineſſe examined again at ſome other time, and ſo diſmiſſed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. The charge of <hi>Francions</hi> perſon was committed to one who kept him <pb n="19" facs="tcp:59287:163"/>Priſoner in his own houſe, untill his Proceſſe could be better drawn up; for he told his Accuſer, that he muſt put his Bill into a better form, and not make ſuch deviations in it, nor allege ſuch things againſt him which he could not prove. After that, he provided a Chamber for <hi>Francion,</hi> and brought him wherewith to eat. As for <hi>Francion</hi> himſelf, he was wonderfully amazed, that he was fallen into this Misfortune. Sometimes he believed that he was taken for ſome other who was called by his Name, or did reſemble him in Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and had been guilty of ſuch Impoſtures; but the counterfeit pieces which were put into his Pocket did check that ſuppoſition, and aſſured him, that it could not be any ſuch miſtake, but a deſign contrived on purpoſe unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to accuſe him to take away his Life. Nevertheleſſe he truſted in his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, which he knew would be then undiſputably apparent, when his Cauſe ſhould be more maturely examined. He had alſo an aſſured confidence of the Aſſiſtance of all of his own Nation that were then at <hi>Rome,</hi> by whom he was wonderfully beloved and reſpected.</p>
            <p>He was not deceived in that belief, for as ſoon as
<hi>Raymond</hi> had made it known that <hi>Francion</hi> was a Priſoner, they all aſſembled themſelves to underſtand the reaſon of it, and to procure his deliverance if it were poſſible. The Lackyes of
<hi>Raymond</hi> had followed the Serjeants, and took notice of the Houſe into which <hi>Francion</hi> was carried. As for his own Lackyes, they had a deſign to play the Waggs, and had left him in the Perfumers ſhop. It was ſome content unto them to know in what place he was; Nevertheleſſe, they placed Spies up and down that Street, to give notice, if peradventure he ſhould be conveyed to ſome other place. They did ſufficiently underſtand the cauſe of his Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but alleged, it was not ground enough to cauſe him to be apprehended; All his Friends did joyntly indeavour themſelves to ſollicit all the Great Ones whom they knew, for his inlargement, by demonſtrating unto them, that he was of an unblamed Converſation, and one who abhorred to commit any frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent act; but on the contrary, that he was indued with ſo much Merit, that all perſons of Honour and Virtue were obliged to defend him. There were many Signiors of
<hi>Italy</hi> who promiſed to uſe all the Authority of their Friends, and their own power, for his liberty. Nevertheleſſe it would not be permitted that at preſent he ſhould have his liberty entirely; for they alleged, he muſt firſt juſtifie himſelf, and that he might be well content to continue in that Houſe, in which he could receive no infamy, ſince it was no ordinary priſon for guilty perſons. This was all they could doe, and thoſe who were of his ordinary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, did addreſſe themſelves to <hi>Raymond</hi> to take counſell what expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents on the next day they ſhould put in practice for his liberty. They found with <hi>Raymond, Audebert</hi> and <hi>Du Buiſſon,</hi> and two or three more,
<hi>Hortenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was alſo there, who was ſtruck into a deep deſpair at the misfortune of his dear <hi>Francion.</hi> He ſaid, that the modern Policy was not well ſtated, to ſuffer ſo much counterfeit and clipped money to paſſe, and not examine from whence it came, for when any one was abuſed with it, inſtead of carrying it to the changers eſtabliſhed by the Prince, he did attempt to make it current, and did abuſe his neighbour with it, as he had been abuſed himſelf. He ſaid, there was no conſcience in it, and it was the cauſe that the Coyners of falſe money, and Clippers of Piſtols, found always one or other to whom to deliver their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit pieces, who did diſtribute them afterwards unto others. That the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys for which <hi>Francion</hi> was apprehended, came from ſome bad place, and was given him in payment, when he could not well diſcover what they were. <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> told him, he muſt not think ſo, for
<hi>Francion</hi> could not be ſo overſeen in taking of money, but thoſe falſe pieces were cunningly conveyed into his Pocket, as he was coming from Church, which he could make apparent to all the world. Every one was amazed at this villany, and the Pedant <hi>Hortenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> began to make invectives againſt the Impoſtors of this age, in which his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59287:163"/>was ſo extravagant, that they could not refrain from laughter, and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Francion</hi> were preſent, to divert him from his melancholy. This gave an occaſion to ſome to exerciſe their fancies on the ſubject which did preſent it ſelf, although they were much afflicted for the captivity of their Friend. <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi> ſaid, That thoſe who were Clippers of Money, were a generation of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout people, for they did go in Proceſſion round about the Croſs. This was but a common fancy, and worthy of the Spirit of ſuch a Man, who on every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion would aſſiſt himſelf with that which he had heard from others. But <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debert</hi> taking the word from him, ſaid unto him. You ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing my brave Doctor, but that is not all, It is rather that they doe follow the faſhion of the world at this day, by undervaluing good Letters, of which you juſtly do complain, and tax the Ignorance of this Age; for you ſhall ſeldom now meet with any pieces of ſilver, but the Letters are almoſt quite clipped away: for the truth whereof, I do refer my ſelf to our Kardecues of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every one commended <hi>Audebert,</hi> in which he made apparent the clearneſſe of his Spirit, and <hi>Raymond,</hi> deſirous to expreſſe himſelf on the ſame Subject, did ſay, That <hi>Francion</hi> was not like unto a certain Man of his Country, who being accuſed for coyning of falſe money, was found ſo guilty, that no man would take his part, except one Gentleman, who being of a nimble apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, aſſured thoſe who were preſent, that it was unjuſt to condemn that Man for coyning falſe money, Becauſe, ſaid he, he hath done no more than what he ought to do. The reaſon being demanded, he made anſwer, That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Man did owe money to all the world, and that he could not but do well to pay his Creditors, becauſe in that he did no more than he ought. This Conceit pleaſed well, but <hi>Hortenſius</hi> would comment on it, to have it the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtood; affirming, that the mony which that Man owed was not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit money, but good; ſo that he did not that which he ought to have done, &amp; did not pay well his Creditors; Nay, ſaid <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> ſuppoſe that to pay his Debts he had coyned good Kardecues, as good as ſuch as come out of the Mint at <hi>Paris,</hi> yet he was worthy of reproof, it being not permitted to any to coyn money, but for the Prince only, and by his Authority; for the coyning of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is a right of Soveraignty which belongeth not unto the Subject. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he cited the Lawes and the Cuſtoms, and ſome fragments of antient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, to add more reputation to his words; But it was told him, he began to be too ſerious, when what they ſpoke was only but in mirth: nevertheleſſe they commended his obſervation, being unwilling to diſcontent him. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he fell again upon the abuſe which was committed, in coyning of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit money, with ſo much choler, that
<hi>Audebert,</hi> perceiving his paſſion, told him, That if ever he ſhould, as he hoped, be King of <hi>Polonia,</hi> he would pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a Declaration throughout his Kingdom, againſt that abuſe. Mock not, ſaid
<hi>Hortenſius,</hi> undoubtedly I will, if God ſhall give me the grace to arrive unto that Dignity, I will make an Ordinance, that thoſe who ſhall be evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced to have altered, or falſified the current money of my Kingdom, ſhall be not only plunged into a Cauldron of burning Oyl, as in ſome Countries that puniſhment hath been inflicted, but I will find out another Invention, which ſhall teſtifie my Knowledge, and my Reading, I will have melted Gold powred into the mouthes of thoſe falſe Coyners, as the <hi>Parthians</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Marcus Craſſus,</hi> as I have read in the Hiſtory, or Epitomy of <hi>Lucius Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and in my Hiſtorical Dictionary, printed at <hi>Lions,</hi> and alſo in many other Authors, and then would I ſay, <hi>Glut thy ſelf with that which thou haſt ſo much loved;</hi> ſo ſpake <hi>Thomiris,</hi> the Queen of the
<hi>Scithians,</hi> to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> cauſing his head to ſwim, and ſink in humane blood. A moſt learned puniſhment, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you, ſaid
<hi>Audebert!</hi> Then what will you ſay to <hi>Craſſus,</hi> who was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of counterfeiting mony, but it may ſuffice that he was extremely avarici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; <pb n="21" facs="tcp:59287:164"/>but what puniſhment will you ordain for thoſe who falſely do accuſe the Innocent as our Friend.
<hi>Fancion</hi> hath been accuſed, I will ordain them the ſame puniſhment, ſaid <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> for they are worthy to ſuffer the ſame torment, which they would procure unto others. That is well thought upon, ſaid <hi>Audebert,</hi> and I would to God that the ſame puniſhment might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take theſe falſe Accuſers.</p>
            <p>The Diſcourſe had continued longer, but the immediate danger of their Friend did draw their thoughts into another, and a more ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; When behold <hi>Dorini</hi> did arrive, to be more fully informed of the Newes which he heard in the City, which was, That a
<hi>French</hi> Gentleman was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended as a great Malefactor, not imagining that it had been <hi>Francion,</hi> although he had heard him named. He profeſſed, that in the Morning he was angry with him, by reaſon of the Inconſtancy of his Loves, and the amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deceit whereby he thought to have circumvented his Kinſwoman <hi>Nays;</hi> but now, he ſaid, he pityed his Misfortune, and would imploy himſelf and all his Friends, to releaſe him from his Captivity; and becauſe it was now Supper time, the reſt of the Company returned to their Lodgings, <hi>Audebert</hi> only and
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> did remain with <hi>Raymond.</hi> As for <hi>Dorini,</hi> he repaired to <hi>Nays,</hi> and related to her the Misfortune into which
<hi>Francion</hi> was fallen, for which ſhe ſeemed not to expreſſe the leaſt ſign of Remorſe; but on the contrary did affirm, that it was ſome ſatisfaction to her, and that no doubt but it was a juſt, and a manifeſt puniſhment from Heaven; for although he had not falſify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any moneys, yet he had falſifyed his affections, and corrupted his Love, which is the ſweeteſt bond in the ſociety of Mankind. Her Coſin at that time would ſpeak no more, becauſe he perceived her anger did ſtill grow upon her; he had ſpoken with her not long before, and related to her what he had heard word for word from <hi>Francions</hi> own mouth, but it was altogether unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</p>
            <p>In the mean time as <hi>Raymond</hi> was at Supper with
<hi>Audebert</hi> and <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> the Officers came unto his Lodging, having a Commiſſion to examine the Trunks and Coffers of
<hi>Francion,</hi> to ſee if there were any more falſe money to be found, or any tools to coyn it with, that they might ſerve as ſo many proofs againſt him. They had alſo a deſign to examine his Servants whether they did aſſiſt him or not; and as they made a great noiſe at the door, being many of them in number, <hi>Raymond</hi> began to ſtand upon his guard, and ſuſpected the affair. Their number ſerved only to be the more prejudicial to them, and to make their deſign the more known, and the more difficult to accompliſh <hi>Raymond</hi> did ſwear that he would hinder them from coming in, as much as lay in his Power, and immediatly he barricadoed the Chamber Door againſt them, for they were become Maſters of the Lower Door already. The reaſon why had they not taken the full poſſeſſion of the whole Houſe, was, becauſe they were poſſeſſed with ſo nice a fear, that they could not agree amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves who ſhould be the firſt man that ſhould force his entrance. It was a pleaſant ſpectacle to behold, that although on other occaſions they would not give the leaſt honour to one another, yet now they ſtood upon the Ceremonies of their Age, and Qualities, and on the order of their places. At the laſt, perceiving that the Door would not be opened, they were advertiſed that there was a back Door in a little lane behind the Houſe: Thither they did run with all the ſpeed they could, and thoſe who were moſt hindmoſt thruſting on thoſe who were before, they inforced them to enter whether they would or not. They found two of <hi>Francions</hi> Lackies, whom immediatly they ſeized on, and carried to the Judge. <hi>Raymond,</hi> who thought not to be ſurprized by them, did now fear that they would apprehend him alſo, as one who did drive the ſame Trade with <hi>Francion,</hi> becauſe he lodged in the ſame Houſe with him; he therefore retired himſelf into an inward Chamber with
<hi>Audebert</hi> and <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> 
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59287:164"/>the better to ſecure himſelf, and the Pedant <hi>Hortenſius</hi> never left ſwearing, Vertue of <hi>Iove,</hi> O that I had now the ſtrength of
<hi>Hercules</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with this Kennel of hounds, I would cut off all their heads at once, had they as many heads as <hi>Hydra;</hi> He made many more ſuch exclamations, which would have made them all to laugh, had not ſome more ſerious thoughts poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed their ſpirits.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Serjeants being entred into
<hi>Francion</hi>'s Chamber, which the Maſter of the houſe was conſtrained to open unto them, did make there a horrible havock, turning upſide down all the moveables, and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very Matt of the Bed; but finding nothing of importance, they took only a box, and two portmantles, with all that was in them, and were about to carry them away: <hi>Raymond</hi> in the mean time obſerving that they did not look after him, was reſolved to go to them, and being a man of a good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, he demanded of them what they did there, and ſeeing they were entred into a conſultation to take away the Coffers and all, and were putting their debate into execution, he began to reſiſt them, and to tell them that they belonged to himſelf, and therefore had no commiſſion to ſearch what was within them. One of them replyed to him, that, if he were a wiſe man, he would not reſiſt the authority of the Judge; yet for all that he continued firm in his reſolution, and <hi>Audebert</hi> alſo and <hi>Hortenſius</hi> with furious looks came up to his aſſiſtance. The Officers, who for the moſt part of them were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to peace and eaſe, and not to be Warriers, were contented to have done as they were commanded, without fighting with thoſe men, who if they had ſlaſhed them ſoundly with their Swords, they were uncertain how to have relieved themſelves, for they were ſtrangers, who might immediatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards fly away, and never be heard of again. Some of them therefore did begin to perſwade them with ſoft words, whiles the other, with all the ſpeed they could, did begin to carry away the Coffers. <hi>Raymond</hi> having with violence forced thoſe back who did pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly with him, he advanced towards the others who were carrying away the booty; they, obſerving his reſolution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to withdraw, and leaving the Coffers behind them, they took their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way to the ſtairs head, with ſo much haſt, that they tumbled down upon one another, and when they were at the door, they ſtood not upon thoſe ceremonies at their going out as they did at their coming in. The Maſter of the houſe ſaid to <hi>Raymond,</hi> that he knew very well that
<hi>Francion</hi> had nothing in his Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers that might be prejudicial to him, for he had ſeen them often opened, he needed not therefore to have troubled himſelf to have detained them. <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> nevertheleſſe purſued the Serjeants to the ſtreet, and obſerving them to make haſt away, he made faſt all the doors, to be in the greater aſſurance. As he was going into his Chamber, he obſerved a man to croſſe the Court, and to run ſometimes on the one ſide of it, and ſometimes on the other, to find his way out. It began to grow dark, nevertheleſſe he perceived that he was not any of the houſe, and conceiving him to be one of the Serjeants Yeomen who had loſt his way; he took him by the Collar, and did drag him to his own Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. The Italian ſeeing himſelf ſurprized, did inceſſantly intreat him to give him leave to be gone, becauſe he came not thither with the leaſt intent to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny harm. What, replyed <hi>Raymond?</hi> And is it poſſible for you, or any other Serjeants in the world, to do any good? Are you not one of that Company who are but now gone? he could not deny it, whereupon <hi>Raymond</hi> told him that he ſhould pay for all the reſt, &amp; as long as <hi>Francion</hi> was under cuſtody, he ſhould be a priſoner alſo; he told him, that he ſhould not goe off neither at ſo cheap a rate, unleſſe (for he aſſured him he ſhould be put to a moſt cruel death) he would declare the Author of the Plots which were contrived againſt <hi>Francion,</hi> and who was the man that did imploy them on that affair. <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> perceived by his Phyſiognomy that he had a wicked and a treacherous <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59287:165"/>Soul, and his own Genius did preſage unto him, that he might underſtand by this Man ſomething of the Conſpiracy againſt the life and the honour of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions.</hi> This man was poſſeſſed with ſo great a fear to hear <hi>Raymond</hi> to ſpeak in this manner to him, that one might read his guilt in his face, for he veryly believed, that if he made not a free confeſſion, <hi>Raymond</hi> would kill him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Compaſſion; he told him therefore that he would confeſſe unto him all that he did know, if he would pardon him his faults, whereupon <hi>Raymond</hi> commanded him to declare unto him readily what he kept concealed in his heart. The apprehenſion of death and torment had left ſuch and impreſſion in his ſenſible parts, that he trembled in every joynt, and was not able to ſpeak: At the laſt, he deſired to have ſome reſpite given him, but <hi>Raymond</hi> would allow him no time at all, whereupon he began to cry for mercy. The Maſter of the houſe did well perceive that <hi>Raymond</hi> had ſtayed that man, for which he was extremely ſorry, for he deſired that no violence might be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to any one in his houſe; for he was afraid that he himſelf might have been accuſed to have taken part with the French, and troubled for it. He therefore beſought <hi>Raymond</hi> that he would diſmiſſe him, but
<hi>Raymond</hi> was in a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full choler, and ſwore that he would kill him himſelf, if he might not be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to do with him as he would.
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> alſo, who at that time was more than a Fool, did begin to ſpeak for him, but he did thruſt him back ſo rudely, that he thought he ſhould have been hurled up the Mountains towards <hi>Polonia,</hi> ſooner than he deſired, ſo that, poor man, he was conſtrained to retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into his own lodging, not daring to make the leaſt complaint. Not long afterwards he returned into <hi>Raymonds</hi> Chamber, where was
<hi>Audebert</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſervants, who did ſecure the priſoner;
<hi>Raymond</hi> continued his threatnings to him, and aſſured him that he ſhould be a dead man before the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, if he would not confeſſe all the circumſtances of his guilt, and told him, that before he killed him, he was reſolved to wrack him. He firſt of all demanded of him who he was, he told him that his name was <hi>Corſegua,</hi> and that he was an antient ſervant to the houſe of <hi>Valerius</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Rome. Raymond</hi> ſuddenly conceived that it was that <hi>Valerius</hi> of whom
<hi>Francion</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had ſpoke unto him, who was his great enemy. Obſerving that this man having confeſſed this did forbear to ſpeak any more, he commanded him to proceed in his confeſſion, but he beſought him to have a little patience till he had reovered his Spirits. <hi>Audebert</hi> told him that he imployed more time and words making in his ſupplication, than in making his confeſſion, &amp; that he muſt anſwer to what was demanded, &amp; not paſſe away the time unprofitably; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſaid, that he could confeſſe nothing elſe, but only that he did aſſiſt the Serjeants; who came to ſearch the lodgings of a man accuſed for coyning falſe money, and although he was no Serjeant himſelf, yet he did oftentimes goe with them as an Aſſiſtant, and as for that which they had done in that houſe, they had received Orders for it from the Court of Juſtice.
<hi>Raymond</hi> told him, that there was more than that in the buſineſſe, for being no Officer of Juſtice, he had ſome ill deſign of his own that brought him along with them. He would not confeſſe any thing, but ſaid, there were many more beſides him who lived altogether on the ſame employments as he did. By little and little he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reaſſume his Spirits, and was reſolved to conceal this ſecret as long as poſſibly he could; but <hi>Raymond,</hi> perceiving his obſtinacy, cauſed a fire to be kindled, and an Iron to be put into it, to burn the foales of his Feet. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan alſo to think upon ſome other torment to rack him, and did propound them all to the wicked <hi>Corſegua,</hi> the more to affright him, But, he ſaid, he could not be perſwaded that men could be ſo unmercifull, as ſo cruelly to uſe thoſe who were after their own Image, and ſo like unto themſelves, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he took upon him the part of a conſciencious and a religious man, and ſaid, It were better to dye, than to wrong a poor neighbour; For his part, his <pb n="24" facs="tcp:59287:165"/>courſe of life was only honeſtly to gain his livelihood, in ſolliciting the cauſes of poor men, or by executing the commandment of the Judges with the Officers of Iuſtice; But for all that, <hi>Raymond</hi> could not be perſwaded that he was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Man. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> pronounced aloud, that if he was guilty of the Injury done unto <hi>Francion,</hi> there were no puniſhment in the World that could be too grievous for him. It was not enough, he ſaid, to tie him to a dead Body, as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zentius</hi> tyed thoſe who had offended him; nor to put him into the brazen Bull, where <hi>Phalaris</hi> did put him who made it; nor to cut off his ey-brows, &amp; rubbing them over with honey, to expoſe him to the heat of the burning Sun, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to ſhut him up in a long Tub ſtuck full of nailes, the ſharp points all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and then tumble it down from the top of a ſteep and a high Mountain, as the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſerved <hi>Regulus;</hi> for whatſoever the experteſt Tyrants in this nature invented, were but pleaſures to the torments which he deſerved. Then turning unto <hi>Raymond,</hi> he ſaid unto him, If you pleaſe, I will ſearch the Books of Antiquity to find out the moſt horrible puniſhments which the moſt barbarous Nations ever uſed, that we may at once put them all in practice on that moſt abhominable perſon who betrayed <hi>Francion. Raymond</hi> could not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from ſmiling at his conceit, and told him he needed not ſo much to trouble himſelf. <hi>Corſegua,</hi> obſerving that they looked merrily round about him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained a greater confidence, inſomuch, that for all the puniſhments which they had threatned to inflict upon him, he would not confeſſe any thing more than what he had ſpoke before; but now the Iron began to be red with heat, and the Grooms had already pucked off his Shoes, when <hi>Audebert</hi> ſaid, Before you put the Iron to the plant of his Feet, give me a cord; He took it, and did wind it under his arm-pits, and afterwards made it faſt to two cramps of Iron, which were ſtruck into the wall under the window: Afterwards they began with another end of a Cord to bind his Leggs with all the force they had, which although it did put him to great pain, yet he ſtill perſiſted in his obſtinacy. <hi>Raymond</hi> ſaid, It was, becauſe they did not uſe him roughly enough; and becauſe he perceived that they were unprovided of Inſtruments to rack him; Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe he was reſolved to burn his feet. Therupon they pulled off his Stockings, and took the hot Iron from out of the Fire. He then perceived that they were in earneſt, &amp; believed he ſhould be a very fool to ſuffer himſelf to be tormented for not diſcovering the truth. He told them then, that if they would forbear to torture him, he would declare unto them whatſoever he did know. <hi>Raymond</hi> aſſured him, that what he had as yet confeſſed was of little or no importance, and that he had contradicted himſelf in it; and moreover, he was confident that he had other ſecrets to reveal, and untill he had declared them to him, he neither could, nor would be ſatisfied. I will then declare unto you all (ſaid
<hi>Corſegua</hi>) and more than you do expect. Begin then, ſaid
<hi>Audebert,</hi> and we will unbind you, that with more eaſe you may diſcharge what lyes upon your Conſcience. But will you promiſe then to pardon me, ſaid <hi>Corſegua?</hi> I ſwear unto you that I will, ſaid
<hi>Raymond.</hi> I told you before, ſaid <hi>Corſegua,</hi> that I was a Servant to <hi>Valerius,</hi> and I told you no untruth in it,
<hi>Valerius</hi> is a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of a good Family, I many years did wear his Fathers Livery, and I have ſince been a Servant to his Son, but I never gained any great fortunes by him; for my Maſter is more in apparence than effect, and his wealth is not ſo obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, as the antiquity of his Family; nevertheleſſe I do love him ſo entirely, that there is nothing in the World which I would not doe for him, except to give away my life, which, to ſpeak the truth, is more dear unto me than all the obligations in the world, as you eaſily may perceive by me; for if I were content to die for him, you ſhould torment me as you pleaſe, rather than I would diſcover his ſecrets to you, which now I doe for the preſervation of my life. Underſtand then, that a long time he hath born a deep grudge to the
<hi>Frenchman</hi> that was yeſterday apprehended, and that before now he hath <pb n="25" facs="tcp:59287:166"/>endeavoured to procure his death, having betrayed him into a Caſtle, from whence he thought he ſhould never have come forth. He was much aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when afterwards he heard he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that he continued to Court <hi>Nays,</hi> whoſe good will he had gained. This did fill him with ſuch rage and jealouſie, that I am not able to repreſent it to you. He himſelf loved <hi>Nays</hi> for her perfections, and for her riches, which would have conduced much to have repaired the Ruines of his Family, and it could not but be a great grief unto him to loſe ſo good a Fortune. Hereupon he was reſolved to deſtroy <hi>Francion,</hi> and to take from him at once both his Life and his Honor, by accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him for coyning of falſe monyes. We have often ſeen him in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and other publick places, and the nimbleſt, and moſt experienced Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purſes in this City have had notice of it, but they could never (untill this morning) convey the money into his Pocket. Immediatly afterwards we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Mercers, That there was a brave <hi>French</hi> Gentleman comming up that Street, who by his out-ſide promiſed to be an advantagious Cuſtomer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; As he paſſed by, they preſſed upon him to buy ſome Silks of them, with much importunity; but at the laſt, of his own accord, he ſtayed at the Perfumers ſhop, where taking the mony out of his Pocket, we immediatly ſeized upon him, and brought him before a Iudge, who is altogether at my Maſters devotion, and will do according to his Direction. There is a Man alſo bribed for a certain ſum of Silver, who hath accuſed <hi>Francion</hi> of divers crimes, which he ſtrongly will maintain. To render the affair more criminal and undoubtfull, I came hither this afternoon with a little Coffer under my Cloak, in which were great ſtore of counterfeit pieces; I had a deſign to have conveyed it into <hi>Francions</hi> Chamber; You were then gone into the City, and the Servants were ſweeping the Chambers, I therefore entred without any difficulty, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to ask for a Friend; but I miſtook one Chamber for another, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of conveying the Coffer into <hi>Francions</hi> Chamber, I have thruſt it into this: I believe you will find it on the further ſide of the Bed. But it was not enough for my Maſter to have done this, He hath given me ſince the Tools al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo which they uſe in the Coyning of falſe mony, which being put into a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern bagg, I brought along with me when I came with the Officers, who were all in a confuſion; My deſign was to have hid them in ſome Cabinet neer unto <hi>Francions</hi> Chamber, and then to have brought thither my Companions, to cauſe them to ſeize upon them, as belonging unto him; but I could not find the opportunity ſo to do: I have therefore hid the Bagg in the Garret, and as I came to advertiſe the Serjeants of it, who had Commiſſion to make a generall ſearch, I found that they were all gone, and that I was left alone to my own deſtruction.</p>
            <p>When he had ſpoke this, they ſearched with a Candle behind the Bed, where they found the little Coffer accordingly as he had ſaid, but they had no key to open it, but by the ſhaking of it, they found, that within it there was great ſtore of money; at the laſt they did break it open by force, and they found that they were all falſe Pieces. As in a deep amazement they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding this, <hi>Corſegua</hi> deſired them that they would lend him a little longer their attention, and thus he continued his Diſcourſe; If what I have now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to you ſhould arive to my Maſters ear, he would be inexorably incenſed againſt me; but he hath no cauſe to complain of me; for having done what I have, I think I have done enough for him, ſince I have thrown my ſelf into the greateſt dangers; And becauſe I have declared unto you his ſecrets, there is no reaſon that I ſhould ſpare others, (although you have not ſollicited me unto it) for I ſhould be ſorry that he alone ſhould be accuſed for an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, when he hath others to be partakers with him. You ſhall underſtand therefore, that <hi>Nays</hi> hath been courted by a <hi>Venetian</hi> Lord, called <hi>Ergaſtus:</hi> He was heretofore wonderfully jealous of my Maſter, and my Maſter was as <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59287:166"/>jealous of him, but becauſe they perceived that neither of them were accepted, and that ſhe neglected their ſervice to countenance a ſtranger, they reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themſelves to enter into a conſpiracy againſt him, and cauſed him to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned in a Caſtle of one of their friends, and immediatly thereupon one <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viati</hi> was hired to counterfeit diſobliging Letters in the name of <hi>Francion,</hi> which were ſent unto <hi>Nays,</hi> to make her believe that he grew weary of her ſervice, and would abandon her for ever, having no mind at all to come to <hi>Rome;</hi> But <hi>Francion</hi> not long afterwards came hither, quite contrary to the expectation of <hi>Valerius</hi> and <hi>Ergastus,</hi> who began both again to be Suters to <hi>Nays,</hi> with ſo much heat and jealouſie, that they both returned to their antient enmity; but underſtanding that <hi>Francion</hi> was the only man in favour, they did ſhake hands again, to confer on this affair, and grew great friends, out of a deſire to ruine him. They have ſworn to imploy all the malice of their art and power againſt him. I have declared unto you already what was the deſign of <hi>Valerius</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy <hi>Francion,</hi> by cauſing him to be condemned to death, nevertheleſſe he is quite out of favour with his Miſtreſſe, for ſhe cares not for him. But <hi>Erga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> hath proceeded another way, as lately I have learned of <hi>Salviati,</hi> a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man, whom he employeth in all his affairs; He knew that a Venetian cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Lucinda</hi> was come hither with her Daughter <hi>Emilia,</hi> not ſo much to ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite her proceſſe (as ſhe would make the world to believe) as to ſee if her Daughter could meet with a better fortune in
<hi>Rome</hi> than in <hi>Venice;</hi> He hath heretofore very much frequented the Company of thoſe Ladies, and hath been very amorous of <hi>Emilia,</hi> with whom, ſome ſay, he hath been too familiar, and will not marry her, becauſe ſhe is but poor, nevertheleſſe he would be glad to hear that ſhe had circumvented ſome other young Gentleman, not for any great good will he doth bear unto her, but to be well diſcharged of her; and becauſe he knew that <hi>Francion</hi> was of ſo amorous a Complexion, that he might eaſily be tempted, he perſwaded himſelf, that at the firſt ſight he would fall in love with her, for according to the ſharpeſt judgement of the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning eyes, ſhe is believed to be one of the moſt beautifull young Ladies that ever Nature produced. The buſineſſe and the difficulty of it was to lay the plot ſo happily, that he might but any where incounter her to repreſent unto her the paſſionate deſire he had to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with her; and to arrive thereunto, he did aſſiſt himſelf with a certain Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick called <hi>Bergamin,</hi> who pretended to love
<hi>Francion</hi> entirely, but who was far more deſirous to oblige
<hi>Ergaſtus</hi> to him, whom he had known a longer time. He brought
<hi>Francion</hi> into a Church, where he knew <hi>Emilia</hi> was to be with her; Mother, he pretended not to know them, the better to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his deſign; He came out of the Church as if he would attend them, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an hour afterwards he came to acquaint <hi>Francion</hi> who they were: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he did make himſelf known to <hi>Salviati,</hi> who called himſelf their Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and who promiſed to bring him to <hi>Lucindaes</hi> houſe, that he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the fait <hi>Emilia,</hi> who did poſſeſſe him with ſuch vehement deſires. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> had no ſooner ſeen her, but he became deſperately inamoured, and did write many Letters to her, all which <hi>Salviati</hi> did deliver. The buſineſſe was ſo managed, that one Evening he came unto <hi>Emilia,</hi> as ſhe was going to Bed, at which time he made a promiſe of marriage to her. He did prevail more in this than
<hi>Ergastus</hi> hoped for, he only expected that he ſhould ſo often fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Lucindaes</hi> houſe, that <hi>Nays</hi> hearing of it, ſhould be ſo much incenſed thereat, as abſolutely for the time to come to renounce him for his perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but obſerve now the height of the misfortune of this poor Gentleman, who on all ſides was entangled in thoſe nets which his Enemies had laid for him. <hi>Salviati</hi> is a man ſecret enough, He never diſcovered to me one word of it, nor ever would have done, if I had not made known unto him, that I had been imployed by
<hi>Valerius</hi> in the like enterpriſes, and yet, I dare ſwear unto
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59287:167"/>you that he had ſtill contained himſelf, if he had not found this liberty of Speech to diſcover but this little amongſt the Bottles and Tobacco Pipes.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Corſegua</hi> made a ſtop, and thoſe who were preſent were all ſurprized with wonder, to hear ſo many malicious and bloody contrivances, which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the revengefull Spirits of the Italians. They wiſhed that Juſtice might take ſuch a ſtrict notice of it, that puniſhment accordingly might be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and that
<hi>Francion</hi> m ght be re-eſtated into his liberty, and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to themſelves ſuddenly to divulge all the particulars, that the Innocence of <hi>Francion</hi> might be acknowledged. <hi>Raymond</hi> ſaid unto
<hi>Corſegua,</hi> that as yet he had no reaſon to be entirely ſatisfied, if he would not promiſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge before the Judges, all that which he had confeſſed before them. He made anſwer, I ſhall then by this means be out of all hopes to re-eſtabliſh my ſelf in the favour of my Maſter; Is it not enough for you that I have declared all theſe ſecrers? No (ſaid
<hi>Raymond</hi>) For although we ſhould allege them, yet no belief would be given to our aſſertations, unleſſe that you do juſtifie them with us. Therefore if you do not promiſe by inviolable oaths to confirm what you have ſpoken, you ſhall not be exempted from Death; But if you ſhall perform what, in reaſon, we ſhall require, I do promiſe you on my part, that you ſhall not ſtand in need to be afraid of your Maſter, but that we will very liberally reward you, and will take you into <hi>France</hi> along with us, if you have of your ſelf a deſire unto it, and moreover we will give you that content, that you ſhall have no cauſe to complain of the Evil which we have done unto you. <hi>Raymond</hi> expreſſed this with ſuch a freedom of Spirit, that <hi>Corſegua</hi> began to aſſure himſelf of the truth of his words, and promiſed to doe whatſoever he would have him, and did ſwear unto him all the Oaths that could oblige a heart to the performance of what he promiſed: But <hi>Audebert</hi> taking
<hi>Raymond</hi> aſide, did repreſent unto him, that this man was but a knave, and no confi-dence could be repoſed in him, and probably, that on the next day, when he ſhould be brought before the Iudges, he would deny whatſoever he had ſpoken, and would not be ſenſible at all of the many imprecations he had made; he repreſented to him, that it was therefore better to force from him ſome other acknowledgement, and to cauſe him to wrire it under his own hand, and to ſign to whatſoever he had confeſſed, that they might repreſent it to the Iudge, to which if they could perſwade him, it would be impoſſible for him to deny it. <hi>Raymond</hi> did approve the motion, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Corſegua</hi> did allege, that they ought not to miſtruſt him, yet Pen, Ink, and Paper, were brought unto him, and he did write, that he had cauſed thoſe falſe pieces to be conveyed into the Pocket of <hi>Francion,</hi> by the Inſtigation of his Maſter, and moreover, that he had brought into his Chamber a Coffer full of the like pieces, together with the Inſtruments and tools of falſe Coyners, maliciouſly to accuſe <hi>Francion,</hi> and to prove him guilty. Having confeſſed this under his own hand, they inforced him to ſign it, and becauſe he ſeemed very unwilling to merchandiſe that buſineſſe,
<hi>Raymond</hi> and <hi>Audebert,</hi> redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their threatnings, did ſo affright him, that he performed whatſoever they deſired. They afterwards ſearched the upper lofts of the Houſe, where they found that he had convayed all thoſe Inſtruments, accordingly as he had ſaid, and they did lay them up, to ſhew them afterwards to the Court of Iuſtice. The night was then far advanced, and <hi>Raymond</hi> commanded his priſoner to be ſhut up in a Chamber, in which were divers of his own Servants, who had him under cuſtody, and cauſed him to lye there for that night. <hi>Raymond</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards did goe to his bed, and <hi>Audebert</hi> and <hi>Hortenſius</hi> did the like, but they could take no reſt, importunately every one deſiring the appearence of the day, to make haſt to the deliverance of their friend. The morning being come, <hi>Raymond</hi> left <hi>Audebert</hi> with his Servants in the Houſe to guard <hi>Corſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua,</hi> and he repaired with
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> to the place where <hi>Francion</hi> was. He
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59287:167"/>demanded of his Keeper to ſpeak with him, for he deſired to acquaint him with this pleaſing News, that he ſhould not grow into too deep a Melancholy, but be in hope after a few Hours to obtain his Liberty. But the rough Keeper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, That he ſhould <hi>not</hi> ſpeak with him, which extremely did perplex him. He had a deſire after that to ſpeak unto the Iudge, which was permitted. He declared to him, That he had taken in his own Lodging a Man who was come with the Miniſters of Iuſtice, and confeſſed to him that he had put the falſe pieces of money into
<hi>Francions</hi> Pocket, and that all which followed thereupon was only the malicious plot of his Enemy <hi>Valerius,</hi> to take away his life; and for his better aſſurance, he ſhewed him the Confeſſion which
<hi>Corſegua</hi> had ſigned. The Iudge perceived well enough that they had detained this Man, although he had received no advertiſement of it, His Companions imagining that he came forth with them by ſome way which they did not well obſerve, ſo that they made no complaint of his detainment. Nevertheleſſe the Iudge ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they had forced him to what he had done, and taking part with <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> whoſe life he knew, he did give a great check to <hi>Raymond,</hi> and told him, that he had made an aſſault upon Iuſtice it ſelf, for having detained that Man, and obliged him to write a Depoſition, which ought not to be made, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Magiſtrates; and that it ſeemed to him, that he himſelf would take upon him the Office of a Magiſtrate for the execution of Iuſtice.
<hi>Raymond</hi> made anſwer, That in that Neceſſity they got from their Enemy what they could, and if he had not done that, he could not have a perfect aſſurance of the Innocence of <hi>Francion.</hi> The Iudge alleged to him, that he had done very ill in it. But he ſaid, I will maintain what I have done; and why ſhould I be compelled to make ſatisfaction? ſeeing I have done a Civil office for my Friend, by which his juſtification is apparent, and undoubted.</p>
            <p>The Proof of his Affection was worthy to be admired; but this barbarous Iudge took no notice of it, although at every word
<hi>Hortenſius</hi> cryed, Behold an <hi>Oreſtes!</hi> Behold a
<hi>Pylades!</hi> Behold the true Paragon of Friendſhip! Doe ſomething for the love to Virtue. But this inexorable Man commanded that they ſhould releaſe <hi>Corſegua,</hi> for <hi>Raymond</hi> confeſſed that he was ſtill at his Lodgings; He commanded ſome of the Serjeants to fetch him.
<hi>Raymond</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it did not much trouble him, becauſe he believed he would not deny his own hand. He therefore ſent <hi>Hortenſius</hi> to his Lodging, to ſpeak to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debert</hi> that he ſhould deliver that Man unto the Serjeants without reſiſtance. This incontinently was done, &amp;
<hi>Audebert</hi> alſo came along with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Iudge, the better to underſtand how the Buſineſſe was managed. They all then ſaid unto the Iudge, If you will not believe what this Man hath teſtified under his own hand, at leaſt, let us deſerve to be believed. Behold three of us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent! we are all of us Gentlemen, and we have five or ſix Grooms, who have heard him all along to confeſſe the conſpiracy which hath been plotted againſt <hi>Francion;</hi> Shall we all be found to be Lyars? I will hear you every one by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, (ſaid the Iudge.) That will import but little (ſaid <hi>Corſegua,</hi>) for I muſt confeſſe, that I have ſpoken all that which they ſay, and that I have written all which they do ſhew unto you; but it is not therefore true, becauſe I have done it. I only did confeſſe it, to preſerve my ſelf from Death, and the Torments which they had prepared for me, and what I have ſigned with my own hand, was only occaſioned by the act of fear.</p>
            <p>In this manner this wretched Man endeavoured to deny all that which he had confeſſed, becauſe he thought himſelf to be now in a place of aſſurance; and the <hi>French</hi> were greatly amazed to ſee his horrible perfidiouſneſſe, calling to mind the many Oathes by which he had obliged both his Soul and Body. The Iudge would do nothing contrary to
<hi>Corſegua,</hi> who was his Friend, and had beſtowed many Preſents on him. He ſaid, he believed they had wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully tormented that poor Man, and proteſted, that thoſe who had done it <pb n="29" facs="tcp:59287:168"/>ſhould be ſeverely puniſhed. <hi>Corſegua</hi> perceiving that the Iudge adhered to him, did ſhew him his naked Body, which in many places had been pinched by the cruelty of his Tormentors. He ſhewed them alſo the marke of the Cord with which they had bound his Leggs a little above his anckle. On this, all the
<hi>Italians</hi> did thunder againſt <hi>Raymond,</hi> and the other of the
<hi>French</hi> Nation, for their unmercifullneſſe, and made all the haſt they could to ſhut the Gate of the Houſe, to be aſſured of his Perſon. <hi>Corſegua</hi> did believe that <hi>Raymond</hi> and
<hi>Francion</hi> were ſufficiently able to reward him, if he would have confeſſed unto the Magiſtrates what he did know of his Maſter; but he conſidered with himſelf, that peradventure he ſhould never goe with them into <hi>France,</hi> and that either <hi>Valerius,</hi> or ſome of his Kinred, would cauſe him to be killed by treachery. This he thought on all the Night before, ſo that he continued in his treacherous reſolution. On the other ſide, the Judge who was preſent, did take counſel to ſend for a ſtrong Guard to ſend the <hi>French</hi> to Priſon, for his own Houſe was not large enough to receive ſo many Priſoners. He was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to commence a Proceſſe againſt them, as well as <hi>Francion,</hi> for being his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices, and for having offered Violence to him who aſſiſted the Serjeants. As he was in this Determination, there were ſome who knocked violently at the Gate, and being admitted, they repreſented to him, that he muſt make appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance himſelf before another Iudge who was Superiour to him. This made him to tremble for fear; for in ſuch Caſes the Iudge is never demanded to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before a Superior, but only for unjuſt proceedings. Being charged to come himſelf, and to bring along with him the
<hi>French</hi> Gentleman who was a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, He immediately did obey the Summons, and <hi>Francion</hi> came forth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with him a multitude of People to attend him. This was a pregnant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the good Diſpoſition of <hi>Dorini,</hi> who, although he conceived that
<hi>Francion</hi> was much to be condemned for having abuſed his Coſin, yet he would not abandon him in his diſtreſſe, but did ſollicit in the favour of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to it by the remembrance of the many merry houres which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they had paſſed together in their agreeable Debauchments. He had been himſelf with <hi>Lucio,</hi> who was the Superior Iudge, and repreſented to him, that the brave <hi>Frenchman</hi> was fallen into the hands of <hi>Caraffe,</hi> who was a Iudge that had a dependance on him, and had an ill Report for many irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar proceedings. <hi>Dorini</hi> alleged to <hi>Lucio,</hi> that it was a ſhame to hear the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinences for which <hi>Francion</hi> was accuſed, which had not the leaſt apparence of Truth, and that of Neceſſity there muſt be much of Malice in his accuſation. He told him, that if he had known the Confeſſion of
<hi>Corſegua,</hi> he could better be enabled to lay open the Caſe unto him, but he was not yet thoroughly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed of it; for thoſe who had been ſent unto his Lodging to acquaint him with it, did not find him within. Nevertheleſſe, that which he had ſpoken was ſufficient to exaſperate
<hi>Lucio</hi> againſt <hi>Caraffe,</hi> who long before had received many complaints againſt him.</p>
            <p>When they were all before him, he did forbid <hi>Caraffe</hi> to meddle any more in the affair of <hi>Francion;</hi> for he ſaid, that the Cognizance thereof ſhould be reſerved to himſelf. <hi>Caraffe</hi> made anſwer, That he did ſubmit unto him in that, and in all other things; nevertheleſſe he would make it apparent, that in this particular he had done nothing unjuſtly, and that <hi>Francion</hi> was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended for putting off falſe Quadrubles to a Merchant, his Pocket being found to be full of them; and that, if his Coffers were examined, which he had cauſed to be arreſted, there would be yet found more of them, and peradventure there might be found with them the Utenſils of his Profeſſion; He certified, That he had cauſed ſome of his Servants alſo to be apprehended, who might diſcover more of their Maſters practice, and could certifie whether their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter did ever imploy them in that felonious exerciſe, or not. For this purpoſe, he cauſed the two Lackyes of <hi>Francion</hi> to be produced, whom the day before <pb n="30" facs="tcp:59287:168"/>before they had apprehended, the one was an <hi>Italian,</hi> the other born in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> both of them very young, and without any knowledge of the affairs of their Maſter, who had not long entertained them in his Service. <hi>Lucio</hi> did eaſily perceive it, after he had heard them ſpeak but two or three words, ſo that he found their teſtimony to be of no effect. Afterwards he cauſed the Boxes to be opened, where he found nothing but Linnen, and his wearing cloaths, and in the Portmantle there was nothing at all but Books and Papers, which were produced, to the ſhame of thoſe who believed they ſhould have found ſome great ſtore of counterfeit moneys in them; for <hi>Corſegua,</hi> before hand, at their firſt entrance into <hi>Raymonds</hi> Lodgings, had advertiſed them, with all ſpeed to ſeize upon a little Coffer which they ſhould find in
<hi>Francions</hi> Chamber, for he intended to have foyſted into his Chamber the Coffer full of the counterfeit Pieces, but by miſpriſion he had hid it in the Chamber of <hi>Raymond,</hi> as by and by we ſhall make apparent.
<hi>Lucio</hi> was at the ſame time informed, that not long before
<hi>Francion</hi> had delivered to his Hoſt all the money which he had, to keep for him, ſo that there was found in his Chamber no money at all, and they who thought to have ſeized upon it, were very much decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>He who brought in the Accuſation the day before, did then begin to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and did declare ſome part of that to <hi>Lucio,</hi> which on the day before he had ſpoken to the other Iudge, but his Fear did make him now more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; But the Magiſtrate, who was of an admirable apprehenſion, did plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover, that he was not well grounded in his Accuſation, and would not vouchſafe him ſo much patience, as to hear him out, were it not only for the recreation which he gave him; for he took much pleaſure to ſee how he fum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in his Accuſation. At the laſt, he demanded of him, How long he had known <hi>Francion?</hi> and what was the life which he did lead? To which he made anſwer, not only in purſute of the Inſtructions which he had received, but according to the extravagant Inventions of his own Brain.
<hi>Lucio</hi> afterwards did put Interrogatories to ſome Deponents concerning the ſame Accuſation; but he found they did nothing agree in their Depoſitions, &amp; that this Informer had no knowledge at all of the party whom he accuſed. All the Proof which he could make againſt him, was, That falſe moneys were found in his Pocket; But <hi>Raymond</hi> came up to the Barre, and declared, That he would make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt this was one of the moſt remarkable Conſpiracies that was ever contrived in <hi>Italy,</hi> or peradventure in the World, &amp; that <hi>Valerius</hi> was the Man who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Francion</hi> to be accuſed for falſe monies. He thereupon declared the whole proceedings of the Conſpiracy, and withall ſhewed what
<hi>Corſegua</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed under his own hand. He afterwards diſcovered in what a great perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty theſe Conſpirators were, becauſe they could not find the falſe money, nor the Utenſils in <hi>Francions</hi> Lodgings; but, he ſaid, He would now doe them the favour to help them out of that Trouble, and would inform them where they were. Thereupon he gave order, that the Leathern Bagg, and the little Coffer ſhould be brought into the Court; Behold! (ſaid he) What they have hid amongſt us, to make the Innocent guilty; but the Invention did not anſwer the expectation.
<hi>Corſegua</hi> did miſtake one place for another, and he himſelf is fallen into my hands ſo happily, that I have cauſed him to confeſſe all, and to ſign his Confeſſion under his own hand. <hi>Corſegua</hi> thereupon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, that whatſoever he had ſpoken, or writ, was only upon Compulſion, and demanded of the Court, that <hi>Raymond</hi> might be inforced by the payment of ſome great Fine, to make amends for having conſtrained him to defame his Maſter, and for tormenting his own Body.
<hi>Dorini,</hi> having heard all this, was wonderfully amazed, nevertheleſſe he was glad that the Innocence of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> ſhould ſuddenly be acknowledged. He therefore was permitted to ſpeak himſelf unto the Magiſtrate, to whom he did demonſtrate, that whatſoever
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59287:169"/>
               <hi>Raymond</hi> had ſpoken in the defence of
<hi>Francion</hi> was true, and he himſelf could juſtifie that
<hi>Valerius</hi> was always an Enemy unto him, and that having not long before betrayed him into a Caſtle, he gave a charge to the Captain thereof, who was his Friend, to put <hi>Francion</hi> to death, but it pleaſed God to preſerve him from that danger.</p>
            <p>The Judge deſired him that he would be pleaſed not to perplex himſelf, for he would impartially do a thorough piece of Iuſtice upon all, and aſſured him, that he already did ſee more clearly into the cauſe than he conceived. The effect did prove, that he did ſpeak the truth, for he compared thoſe things which he did then hear, with thoſe which were already paſſed, and from thence he did draw infallible conſequences of truth. He himſelf did open the Bags where the Inſtruments were, amongſt which he found a ſmall Seal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and the tooles that made it, by miſ-regard huddled in amongſt the reſt, on which were the Arms of <hi>Valerius,</hi> ſo that this was a proof evident enough to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that all the other tools, with the Seal, came from his houſe, and did render <hi>Valerius</hi> more guilty than was before conceived; For to what uſe did thoſe tools ſerve him? Did he make them on purpoſe to have them carryed into <hi>Francion</hi>'s Chamber? Did he find them made to his hand, as ſoon as ever he had the deſign to betray
<hi>Francion,</hi> or could he poſſibly cauſe them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be made in ſo ſhort a time? Of this laſt there was but little apparence. It muſt be therefore, that he had them lying by him many years, and that he had made uſe of them himſelf. The affairs of his houſe having been a long time in an ebbing condition, and he himſelf having not wherewith to maintain ſo great a train, did make uſe of this dangerous profeſſion, in which this wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <hi>Corſegua,</hi> and ſome others as yet undiſcovered, did aſſiſt him, and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſegua</hi> himſelf, not ſix moneths before, had been accuſed for the ſame fact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Caraff;</hi> but this petty Iudge, who had his Conſcience both ſtained and ſeared, did ſave him at that time from the danger of the Law, by excuſes as falſe as was his money, <hi>Valerius</hi> having filled his Purſe with pieces more cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent than thoſe which he ordinarily vented. The Superiour Iudge, whoſe name was <hi>Lucio,</hi> did clearly petceive it; but his diſcretion would not make it apparent at that preſent, and he reſerved himſelf to another occaſion, to puniſh the corruptions of <hi>Caraff;</hi> he had found enough beſides for this preſent Cauſe to conſerve the Integrity of Iuſtice. The crime of <hi>Valerius</hi> was evidently verified, and for that of
<hi>Caraff</hi> he had received alſo information heretofore. There remained nothing to clear the cauſe which was under preſent conſideration; and as
<hi>Lucio</hi> was intent on the diſpatch thereof, he turned to
<hi>Corſegua,</hi> and taking him aſide, he ſaid unto him, that he was a wretched fellow to deny a thing which he had confeſſed before ſeveral perſons, and which he had alſo ſigned with his own hand. He aſſured him, that if he continued in his perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he would give ſentence againſt him, and afterwards ſend him to the Gibbet. <hi>Corſegua</hi> for all this did think to make uſe of his accuſtomed Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but
<hi>Lucio</hi> did ſo affright him, that he confeſſed, that whatſoever
<hi>Raymond</hi> had declared, was very true, and that under his own hand he had acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged no more of the things in relation unto the conſpiracy againſt <hi>Francion,</hi> but as in order they were done, and as he knew them to be ſo. It was moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to allege that <hi>Raymond</hi> ſhould have ſuggeſted them unto him, or had conſtrained him to write them down, and afterwards to ſign them; for how could he ever entertain ſuch Inventions in his thoughts, which did agree ſo well with the Intentions and the malice of <hi>Valerius?</hi> This <hi>Lucio</hi> did conſider of before hand, and examined <hi>Corſegua</hi> on the fact of his Maſter, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him, where he found or had thoſe tools with which he coyned the falſe pieces? to which he made many impertinent anſwers; but
<hi>Lucio</hi> had already given order that <hi>Valerius</hi> ſhould be apprehended and carryed to priſon, which was ſuddenly put in execution; and ſeeing the perverſeneſſe and ſtubborneſſe <pb n="32" facs="tcp:59287:169"/>of
<hi>Corſegua,</hi> he commanded that he ſhould alſo be carryed thither with the ſame Man who had accuſed <hi>Francion;</hi> The Accuſer being taken aſide, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by himſelf, did almoſt preſently confeſſe, that whatſoever he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before, was very falſe, and did now juſtifie the truth of what his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had, not long before, acknowledged. The Innocence of <hi>Francion</hi> was then moſt manifeſt. The Iudge believed that it would be a piece of injuſtice to detain him priſoner any longer; wherefore he did aloud pronounce, that he was free to go where he pleaſed, and that thoſe ſhould be ſeverely puniſhed who unjuſtly had accuſed him. But <hi>Bergamin</hi> and <hi>Salviati</hi> who were both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, did immediatly addreſſe themſelves unto the Magiſtrate. They had thruſt themſelves into the throng, to obſerve what ſhould become of <hi>Francion,</hi> for they were acceſſary to the accuſation which was formed againſt him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that he was acquitted, and found innocent, they propounded to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that he would not ſtay long in <hi>Rome,</hi> but it was likely enough would ſo obſcure himſelf, that they could not readily be revenged of him. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded therefore betwixt themſelves, to arreſt him at the Sute of <hi>Lucinda</hi> and <hi>Emilia,</hi> by which means they ſhould either conſtrain him to eſpouſe whom he profeſſed to have loved, or at leaſt to have him condemned to pay great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, and make amends by ſome vaſt ſums of money to <hi>Emilia: Salviati</hi> was he who did plead againſt him, as being moſt experienced in thoſe affairs; He declared to the Judge, that he oppoſed the liberty of <hi>Francion,</hi> who ought to be detained for another crime, for he alleged that he had promiſed matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to the Daughter of <hi>Lucinda,</hi> whom he was accuſtomed to viſit in the night, ſo that he could not repair her honour but only by marrying of her.
<hi>Raymond</hi> did very well underſtand this accuſation, and beſought
<hi>Lucio</hi> that <hi>Corſegua</hi> might be ſent for again, that by him he might better underſtand the Truth of that affair; <hi>Lucio</hi> did immediatly ſend for him, and the Meſſenger did overtake him, being yet not gone ſo far as half way unto the Priſon. When he was returned,
<hi>Raymond</hi> demanded of him if he did not know <hi>Salvia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> and if it were not he who was imployed on the affairs of <hi>Ergaſtus,</hi> and who had told him of all the deſign which that Signior had contrived to deceive
<hi>Francion,</hi> by tempting him to love a Lady, with whom he himſelf had already been familiar, to the end that he might loſe the favour of another Lady, whom they both courted? <hi>Corſegua</hi> did readily acknowledge it, for he would have been ſorry, if his Maſter only &amp; himſelf had been found guilty in the Treachery. He was of the ſame diſpoſition as almoſt all guilty men are, who are glad to have Companions in their wickedneſſe.
<hi>Lucio</hi> perceived that this <hi>Emilia</hi> had been a Maid too liberal of her honour, ſo that a man could not be much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to her, when ſhe had agreed but to grant him that, which ſhe had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given to another. Otherwiſe the complaint of <hi>Salviati</hi> had not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together inconſiderable. As for <hi>Francion,</hi> he always affirmed that he never promiſed any thing to <hi>Emilia,</hi> neither did he boaſt that he ever had received from her the leaſt favours of Love: And as for the reſt, it was no honour for her, nor for any that did belong unto her, if they would make the world to believe, that he had known her too familiarly, when he had ſo often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted to the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francion</hi> having thus cleered himſelf, the pleading of
<hi>Salviati</hi> did paſſe for an indiſcretion, when the Court immediatly afterwards was inforced to give Ear to the complaint of one of the Serjeants who was then preſent; who ſeeing that <hi>Bergamin</hi> and
<hi>Salviati</hi> would arreſt <hi>Francion</hi> for a Treſpaſſe of Love, he would alſo arreſt <hi>Raymond</hi> on the ſame Action. He had almoſt ſince his firſt coming into <hi>Rome</hi> taken notice of him, for a man who had done him a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble affront, but until this preſent he had not the opportunity to revenge himſelf. At laſt advancing towards the Iudge, he with joyned hands did beſeech him (poynting to <hi>Raymond</hi>) to doe juſtice on that Gentleman, whom he did ſhew <pb n="33" facs="tcp:59287:170"/>unto him, becauſe he had diſhonoured his houſe. The Iudge made anſwer to him, That he ſhould declare how it was done; whereupon, with a low and trembling voice he proceeded, Sir, I will repreſent unto you a ſtrange thing: You are to underſtand, that one Morning departing very early out of my houſe to ſollicit my own affairs, and being inforced to return ſooner than I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, becauſe I had forgot one of my Writings, which was a Paper of great importance, I found this <hi>Frenchman</hi> in my Chamber, making much of my Wife, who was not then quite ready. You know how ill at
<hi>Rome</hi> we doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that any one ſhould enter ſo privately, and familiarly into our Houſes, eſpecially into our Wifes, whom we cannot keep with Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance enough. I much reproved my Wife for giving permiſſion to that Man to come unto her, and I ſpake alſo very angrily unto him; but he excuſed himſelf, alleging it was the faſhion of his Country, which he could not forget; not conſidering that we here live otherwiſe at
<hi>Rome.</hi> For the reſt, he came unto me (he ſaid) upon ſerious buſineſſe, and deſired me to acquaint him with the proceedings at Law of a Gentleman, a friend of his, with whom I had ſome acquaintance. That Excuſe made well for him, for I was thoroughly inſtructed in that affair, and I had ſome Papers in my Cloſet which did much concern it. Going therefore to look them out, and the other Paper which I had forgotten, I had no ſooner turned my back, but this wicked man followed me, and made faſt the Door upon me, and did double-lock it; I cryed, and knocked; but he would not open it: I commanded my Wife to come and diſ-ingage me; but ſhe told me, ſhe could not; and, in effect, that Traytor afterwards did take my Wife, to doe with her as he would himſelf. The Door of my Cloſet was made of two Boards, which were placed at ſuch a diſtance, that they were the bredth of two fingers the one from the other, I know not whether it were for good luck, or for ill luck, but I could there ſee all that they were doing to my prejudice, that afterwards I might have by law ſome recompence for it: Nevertheleſſe I evidently perceived my Misfortune through the cleft of the Door: I cryed out againſt my Wife; but ſhe ſaid, That the Man did force her: I exclamed alſo againſt him, and gave him a thouſand ill words; but he would return no anſwer to them at all. I curſed them both with all my heart, and took down from the hook an old Fox which I had in my Cloſet, and having unſheathed it, I did thruſt, and thruſted the blade through the cleft of the Door, threatning to kill that <hi>French</hi> Traytor, if he would not open the Door unto me; but I could not reach him with it, and I was in ſuch a rage, that ſo violently I did beat the hilts and the blade againſt the chair in my Cloſet, that I thought I had broken it all in pieces. I retired my ſelf a little, and came afterwards again to the Door, againſt which I did ſo thunder, that if it had not been ſtrong, and new, I am confident I had laid it on the floor. At the laſt my Wife came and opened the Door, and I, furious as I was, did run after that treacherous
<hi>Frenchman</hi> to kill him; but he ſaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by flight. I turned my ſelf to my Wife, and ſaid unto her, That if I had known ſhe had been conſenting to that which was paſſed, I would Maſſacre her immediatly. She did proteſt unto me, That her Body was as undefiled as her Conſcience; and that the <hi>Frenchman</hi> had vainly exerciſed his ſtrength againſt her, which ſo forcibly ſhe did reſiſt, that he could not accompliſh his Deſires. And indeed, it did ſeem to me, to be as ſhe ſaid; but withall, it may be ſhe ſo extremely laboured to reſiſt him, that ſhe could not feel what he was doing to her. Moreover, ſhe confeſſed, that this luxurious <hi>Frenchman</hi> going away, did ſwear unto her, That what he did was only in mirth, and that he had not loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked me up in my Cloſet, nor offered any familiarities to her, but only to laugh at my jealouſie. She, poor woman, was ſo ſimple as to believe it; but I could not entertain that Conceit, knowing well enough the wanton Diſpoſitions of the
<hi>French.</hi> Since that time, I could never find ſo apt an opportunity as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59287:170"/>this to make my Complaint againſt him; I demand therefore ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the diſhonour ſuſtained, and that the Offender may be corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed.</p>
            <p>This Man did not Declare unto the Iudge this Hiſtory with ſo low a Voice, but there were ſome others beſides the Iudge who did take notice of it; ſo that the News thereof did paſſe from one unto another, and every one did know the Misfortune of the Serjeant. All that he had ſpoken againſt <hi>Raymond</hi> was true, but therein he ſhewed him away to excuſe himſelf; for <hi>Raymond</hi> perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame Story which the Woman had made unto her Husband, and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, That he had not diſhonoured the Woman: for all that he did, was but a gallantry to paſſe away the time, without the leaſt evil Intention. <hi>Lucio,</hi> who oftentimes had heard of the Wife of this Serjeant, and that ſhe had made him a Cuckold, (although he believed himſelf to be none) would have this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to paſſe no further; but told him, That he ought to be ſatisfied with that which <hi>Raymond</hi> had declared. But he proteſted againſt this Sentence of the Iudge, with great contumaciouſneſſe, inſomuch that the Iudge told him, He was too blame, ſo paſſionately to deſire, and indeavour to prove that his Wife had diſhonoured him, when by her own, and <hi>Raymonds</hi> Depoſition, it was apparent that it was not ſo. He was therefore conſtrained to hold his peace, and there were ſome preſent, who ſuſpected the Truth of their Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and reſolved with themſelves to make ſome Mirth of it to his Reproach. <hi>Raymond,</hi> although he was of a bold and hardy Spirit, yet he was now aſhamed to have his Loves laid open before ſo grave a Iudge. To take away therefore the remembrance of it, he addreſſed himſelf to <hi>Francion,</hi> and did conferr with him of his own affair; aſſuring him, that he had managed his buſineſſe with that Diſcretion and Dexterity, that he had diſcovered the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies of his Rivals, and believed, that when <hi>Nays</hi> ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed of it, ſhe would moderate her paſſion. And afterwards, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf to <hi>Dorini,</hi> he ſaid unto him, That he might remonſtrate unto <hi>Nays,</hi> that if <hi>Lucinda</hi> and
<hi>Emilia</hi> had been with her, to make her believe that <hi>Francion</hi> had failed in his Faith, it was an Enterpriſe to which they were carried violently, by the artifice and contrivement of <hi>Ergastus,</hi> which reflected on two conſiderations; the one, by that means to deliver himſelf from <hi>Emilia;</hi> and the other, to hinder <hi>Francion</hi> from marrying
<hi>Nays. Dorini</hi> made anſwer, That he heard what <hi>Corſegua</hi> had confeſſed, and that he could wiſh, with all his heart, that his Coſin would entertain an aſſured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of it.</p>
            <p>Whiles they were in this Conference, there came a Meſſenger to
<hi>Lucio,</hi> to inform him, that there were two Ladies who attended to ſpeak with him; whereupon, becauſe he had diſpatched a great part of his affairs, he did go down into his Hall to entertain them. It was
<hi>Lucinda</hi> and <hi>Emilia,</hi> who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving underſtood that
<hi>Francion</hi> was accuſed for counterfeited monies, they did belive that he had been condemned to die, and thought it diſhonourable to entertain any more any thought of him. <hi>Bergamin</hi> and <hi>Salviati</hi> were ſtill in the Court, and, for the preſent, did forget to acquaint them with the News of his Iuſtification. Theſe two Ladies underſtood, that
<hi>Ergaſtus</hi> was at that preſent in <hi>Rome,</hi> and did conjecture, that <hi>Francion</hi> being to be put to Death according to Iuſtice, this
<hi>Venetian</hi> Signior would be a Suter again to <hi>Nays:</hi> ſo that
<hi>Emilia</hi> ſhould loſe all her hopes to enjoy him. She deſired, that if ſhe failed in one Husband, ſhe might be ſure of another, who, in effect, was more obliged to her. The Mother ſaid to <hi>Lucio,</hi> that ſhe was come to declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, That when they were at <hi>Venice,</hi> this Signior <hi>Ergastus</hi> had ſo paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately deſired, and did ſo much delight himſelf in the Company of her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that ſhe had a Child by him, of which ſhe was brought to Bed before her <pb n="35" facs="tcp:59287:171"/>time, nevertheleſſe he hath ſince broken all his vowes, and falſified his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to eſpouſe her, by reaſon of her poverty, inſomuch that ſhe was inforced to wait upon him, to demand juſtice againſt the Jmpoſtor. The Iudge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that it was not neceſſary for her ſo openly to reveal the diſhonour of her Daughter, and that ſuch a cauſe ought more gently to be handled; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore adviſed her to ſend for <hi>Ergaſtus</hi> to underſtand his reſolutions. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies did ſeem both of them to approve it, for the Iudge did appear to be incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them; He therefore commanded one of his Servants to goe unto
<hi>Erga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> lodgings, and to deſire him to take the pains to come unto him with all the ſpeed he could. He lodged not far from the Iudges houſe, ſo that he came preſently unto the Iudge. <hi>Lucio</hi> repeated to him what the Ladies had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and demanded of him, if he could deny it?</p>
            <p>He was not ſo impudent as to contradict the truth, but, after ſome little pauſe, he ſaid, that <hi>Emilia</hi> peradventure had no more reaſon to remember her anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent affections, ſince ſhe had entertained ſuch new ones, as lately to permit one <hi>Francion</hi> to have free acceſſe unto her. Speak you not of that (ſaid <hi>Lucio</hi>) It is you your ſelf who are the cauſe of it, and you did it to circumvent the Gentleman, and by that means to remove him from anothers love, where he was coverſant with you, and more favoured than your ſelf. <hi>Ergaſtus</hi> was much amazed to perceive that the Iudge underſtood ſo much of his affairs. He was ſo circumſpect as not to ſpeak too boldly, yet he would perſwade the Iudge to believe, that he had never any thing to do with
<hi>Francion;</hi> but the Iudge replyed, that he could preſently produce a man to witneſſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and moreover, <hi>Emilia</hi> on her behalf could produce ſo many proofs againſt him, that if he would not be content to marry her in Love, he ſhould be conſtrained to it by Iuſtice. He then alleged, that his true Iudge was at <hi>Venice,</hi> and that there was the place to which <hi>Emilia</hi> ought to appeal; But <hi>Lucio</hi> did demonſtrate to him, that thoſe who mere injured might demand Iuſtice in the place where they were, and that he, being then reſident in <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as <hi>Lucinda</hi> and <hi>Emilia,</hi> was to be adjudged by the Magiſtrates of that City. <hi>Ergaſtus</hi> was touched with a remorſe of Conſcience, and with the new temptations of <hi>Emilias</hi> beauties. He remembred the many promiſes which ſometimes he had made unto her, &amp; ſeemed to be ſorrowful that he had abandoned her; He therefore ſaid to the Iudge, that he would take ſome time for the better accommodation of that affair; but the Iudge made anſwer, that he could allow him no delay, and if he demanded any, he muſt put in ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the performance of his promiſe. Hereupon <hi>Lucio</hi> cauſed <hi>Dorini</hi> to be called, who was one of his familiar friends, and told him, how he had imployed himſelf to make a marriage betwixt <hi>Ergaſtus</hi> and <hi>Emilia,</hi> and gave him a ſhort account of that which happened: <hi>Dorini</hi> ſeemed to be much amazed at it, but moſt of all, that having made himſelf ſure to
<hi>Emilia,</hi> he ſo paſſionately ſhould court his Kinſwoman
<hi>Nays;</hi> He told <hi>Ergastus,</hi> that he underſtood well enough that he did bear a great affection unto <hi>Nays,</hi> but he ought no longer to entertain any hope that ſhe would conſent to marry him, for at that time when ſhe rejected <hi>Francion,</hi> ſhe accepted not of him, having never any incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to him. This cauſed him to accompliſh what he had begun, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt faithfully promiſed that he would marry <hi>Emilia,</hi> and for the time to come that he would conſtantly entertain her with all the teſtimonies of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned affection. Her beauty indeed was ſo rare, that he might be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with it, and although her Mother was poor, and intangled in variety of Sutes in Law, yet ſhe had great hopes to gain her proceſſe. <hi>Lucinda</hi> was even raviſhed with joy, to ſee that ſhe ſhould have him for her Son-in-Law, whom always ſhe had ſo much deſired; As for <hi>Francion,</hi> and the hopes which ſhe entertained of him, it was only by the Inſtigation of others, who did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her that it would be for the advantage of her Daughter, and <pb n="36" facs="tcp:59287:171"/>becauſe at that time ſhe could hope for nothing from
<hi>Ergaſtus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Signior then did ingenuouſly confeſſe, that a long time he had born an ill will to <hi>Francion,</hi> and that only to bring his own ends about he did put it into <hi>Lucindas</hi> head to diſcover her ſelf to <hi>Nays,</hi> to the end ſhe might hate him, whom ſhe was about to marry; Moreover he confeſſed, that if <hi>Bergamin</hi> was to look out
<hi>Francion,</hi> to make known unto him the complaints of <hi>Emilia,</hi> it was not without his advice, to make a tryal what he would doe, and if he would change <hi>Nays</hi> for <hi>Emilia. Dorini</hi> being aſſured of this, did beſeech <hi>Lucio</hi> to take the pains to goe unto his Coſin, who alſo was allyed to her himſelf, that by reſolving her in theſe uncertainties, he might take away the diſcontents which ſhe entertained againſt
<hi>Francion.</hi> He was willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him, for what would not any man doe for ſuch a Lady? After that <hi>Lucinda, Emilia,</hi> and
<hi>Ergaſtus</hi> were departed, and every one of them well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
<hi>Lucio</hi> conſidered with himſelf what he had yet to do with thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which were brought before him. As for the complaint of the Serjeant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Raymond,</hi> he found it was but frivolous; For that of
<hi>Salviati</hi> againſt <hi>Francion</hi> it was already anſwered, and both the Sollicitor <hi>Salviati,</hi> and <hi>Bergamin</hi> were departed in a confuſed ſhame. As for <hi>Corſegua,</hi> he was ſent back to Priſon, and all the Officers of Iuſtice being diſmiſſed, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained none but the French Gentlemen, who all thanked <hi>Lucio</hi> for the great Act of Iuſtice which he performed, and above all of them <hi>Francion,</hi> who was he that was moſt intereſted in it. <hi>Dorini</hi> then acquainted him with the happy conjunction betwixt <hi>Ergaſtus</hi> and <hi>Emilia,</hi> of which he was wonderfully glad; and that his joy had a greater cauſe to inlarge it ſelf, when he underſtood that <hi>Lucio</hi> and <hi>Dorint</hi> were both of them taking the pains to ſatisfie <hi>Nays,</hi> and to ſtop the proceedings of the proceſſe which ſhe had commenced againſt him.
<hi>Lucio</hi> then ſmiling, ſaid unto them, that for ordinary perſons he cauſed them to come to his own Houſe, to hear and to determine their Cauſes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, but as for his kinſwoman <hi>Nays,</hi> ſhe deſerved that he himſelf ſhould wait upon her. <hi>Francion</hi> did proteſt unto him that he did owe him all obligations, and ſpeaking thoſe words, <hi>Lucio</hi> departed to the Houſe of <hi>Nays</hi> with
<hi>Dorini.</hi> It was ordered, that <hi>Francion</hi> ſhould have his Coffers and his moveables carried back to his own lodgings, to which he returned with <hi>Raymond, Audebert,</hi> and <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> who always were preſent to aſſiſt him. But on the way they beheld a ſpectacle which did more amaze them, than can poſſibly be repreſented.</p>
            <p>They heard behind them ſo great a hooping and hallowing of Men and Boys, and an outcry of Women, that they were inforced to look back, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they diſcovered a young Man, who had nothing but his ſhirt on his Back, and not ſo much as ſhoes on his feet, who was followed by a number of the Kennel-rakers, who made a perpetual ſhout. He did run with all the ſpeed he could make. They immediatly perceived that it was <hi>Du Buiſſon:</hi> It did much afflict them to ſee him in ſuch an equipage, for they conceived that he had either received ſome affront, or that he had loſt his underſtanding; and this laſt conception ſeemed to be the more probable, becauſe ſometimes he would make a flouriſh with a Cudgel which he had ſnatched from a Lackey, and ſometimes he would lay about him, as if he had a quarter ſtaff in his hands, and ceaſed not to ſing a thouſand catches, and idle ſongs. As he ran by us, he ſeemed not to take notice of us, only he gave <hi>Hortenſius</hi> a ſound box on the ear. Then the ſhouts began to be doubled, and he did run away as faſt as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Some ſaid he was drunk; Others, that he was a Madman; Some were of opinion that he was diſtracted with a Calenture, and that the Air of <hi>Rome</hi> was obnoxious to the greateſt part of the French Nation; others affirmed that it was ſome deſperate and wilfull humour in him, and that the beſt courſe was to ſtop him, and to bind him Hand and Feet. But our French Gentlemen would not permit that any violence ſhould be offered to him, and followed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59287:172"/>him unto the Houſe where <hi>Raymond</hi> lodged, into which he did fling himſelf. They were there almoſt as ſoon as himſelf; when he ſew them, he counſelled them to ſhift for themſelves from that vile Rabble, and to give him leave for ſome few Hours to take his Reſt. They then perceived that he had not loſt his Senſes; and bringing him into a Chamber where a good Bed was, they adviſed him to lie down, &amp; ſome of them opening the Bed-cloaths, he nimbly ſlipt in betwixt the Sheets. Having taken a little reſpite, he did ſpeak in this manner to his Friends, Of Neceſſity in this place I muſt declare unto you my Follies; I have been oftentimes to ſee the Courteſans of this City, with whom I took pleaſure to commerce, as I have been accuſtomed to do with thoſe of <hi>France.</hi> There is one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who ſeemed to have a deſire to make a trial of my abilities, her Name is <hi>Fia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metta,</hi> I promiſed not to come unto her untill this Night, but I could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to go unto her yeſterday in the Evening; for although my head was much troubled with the accident which did befall <hi>Francion,</hi> yet I would not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to my ſelf to give my ſelf all the pleaſures that I could privately, I therefore conveyed my ſelf into her Houſe, and did ſpeak unto her Servant, who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me to enter into a Wardrobe, where ſhe told me I muſt attend, until a Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of her Miſtreſſes was departed, being unwilling that he ſhould be a witneſs of her Loves. At the laſt, the Maid returned, and told me, that he was gone, and that I had nothing to do, but to undreſſe my ſelf, and to go to bed to <hi>Fia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metta.</hi> I was unwilling to obey her, alleging, that I deſired to ſalute her firſt; but ſhe in a frolick humor did begin to pull off my cloaths her ſelf, and told me, it would commend the ſport, if I ſhould go and ſurpriſe her Miſtreſſe. When I was naked to my shirt, ſhe opened the Door of the Wardrobe, and cauſed me to paſſe along without a Candle, which willingly I did, thinking it was the ready way to goe into her Chamber; I was no ſooner gone out, but immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe made faſt the Door upon me; I then ſuſpected that ſhe had deceived me. Attempting to go forward, I thought I ſhould have broke my Neck; for I thought the way was plain and even, but I fell down a pair of Stairs, and brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed both my Leggs, and my recourſe was unto the Door again of the Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe, where I cried, and knocked with both my fiſts; but the Maid ſervant told me, If I would not be civil, and hold my peace, ſhe would ſend one to me, who would make me quiet. I hoped to prevail upon her by Promiſes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties; but I found that to be unprofitable. She continued her threats ſo much, that I was conſtrained to be ſilent. Although that in the time of Day it is warm enough at <hi>Rome;</hi> yet the Nights, I promiſe you, are very cold, &amp; very unfriendly, I am ſure the laſt Night was ſo to me. Upon my life I never knew a colder. I ſate upon one of the Stairs, ſtooping with the fore-part of my Body, and drawing up my lower parts as cloſe as ever I could unto it to keep the cold from them. When the day appeared, I was a long time ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my Complaint, without receiving any anſwer; and I believe that the Maid of the Houſe was commanded forth on purpoſe, that ſhe might not be obliged to ſpeak unto me. At the laſt a great Lubber came down the Stairs, having a Sword in one hand, and a Bulls pizzle in the other, and giving me a blow with the pizzle on my ſhoulder, he commanded me to be gone; I was inforeed to go down the Stairs, being not able to make him underſtand my Reaſons, and without any hope to have my Cloaths reſtored. I found that at the Bottom of the Stairs there was a hole made to goe out into a little Lane, thorough which he violently did thruſt me, and afterwards made it faſt againſt me. I ſtayed there without Doors ſitting on a Stone, being in a deep meditation what to do. But few perſons travelled that way, for the Lane had but one paſſage which was directly thorough it, and thoſe who walked by, were people of a mean Condition. I complained to them, that my cloaths were taken from me. Some of them laughed at me, ſaying I was ſerved well enough, becauſe I was ſo ſtiff, and of ſo high a humour, as to give a viſit to <pb n="38" facs="tcp:59287:172"/>the <hi>Roman</hi> Ladies. Others pitied me, and told me, they were not able to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt me. Sometimes I would not ſpeak a word at all, and I believe I was taken for a Beggar; for ſitting all Night upon the Stairs, which were covered with Duſt, my ſhirt was extremely fowl. At the laſt, I conſidered with my ſelf, that I might ſtay there long enough, if I did not take ſome other Courſe; and to be gone in that naked poſture, when it was broad Day-light, would appear very ſtrange; I conceived therefore, that it was my beſt courſe, by ſome Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to adviſe my Friends of my Misfortune, and to deſire them that ſome Cloathes might be diſpatched to me. I did ſpeak to one Man, but I believe he could not find my Lodging; he made me ſtay a long time in expectation of him, and I believe he is not yet returned. At the laſt, I entertained in my Spirit a dangerous and a brisk Conceit, which was, to counterfeit a Mad-man, rather than to ſtay alwayes there. I generouſly advanced, and paſſing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the Streets, I did ſing a thouſand Jiggs and Songs. The Boys in amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment flocked round about me, and I believe had done me much miſchief, had not you aſſiſted me. If I have given a box on the ear to
<hi>Hortenſius,</hi> it was only to authorize my Folly, and I crave pardon of him with all my heart. <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> replyed, That he did pardon him, but adviſed him to take heed how he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured again to ſeek for Forrage in ſuch reproachfull places. <hi>Raymond</hi> told him, That he received a puniſhment great enough for turning out of the right way. But my brave
<hi>Raymond,</hi> ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi> Have not you alſo had your part? Have not you received ſome Diſhonour, concerning what hath been publiſhed of your Loves before the Judge himſelf? <hi>Raymond</hi> replyed, If you had but ſeen the Wife of the Serjeant, you would confeſſe ſhe was worth that Penalty; and although ſhe is but of a low Condition, yet ſhe is not the leſſe amiable. Whatſoever ſhe is (ſaid <hi>Francion,</hi>) I am very glad to underſtand that adventure; for you can now reprove me no more for being ſo ſecret in my love unto <hi>Emilia:</hi> I ſaid truly enough, when I affirmed to you, That there are ſome things, the Secrets whereof we ought to reſerve unto our ſelves. But let us return to the Diſaſter of
<hi>Du Buiſſon;</hi> Will no Man goe to demand his Cloathes? Was there any ſtore of money in your Pockets? A great deal, ſaid <hi>Du Buiſſon;</hi> but I will give it all to <hi>Fiametta,</hi> if ſhe will return but my cloaths unto me. She ſhall be ſure to receive both diſgrace, and loſſe, if ſhe will not reſtore them. <hi>Francion</hi> did ſo well comply with him, that he perſwaded the Hoſt to go, and ſent ſome Lackyes with him, who ſo much threatned <hi>Fiamet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> that ſhe ſurrendered the Cloathes. In the mean time, the Crew that raiſed the Coyl, being the Offals of the City, ſtood ſtill before the Door, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Du Buiſſons</hi> comming forth; but they cauſed them all to depart, alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to them, That he was a poor young Man who had a Feaver on him, and was now much diſtempered in his Bed.</p>
            <p>When the hour was come to goe to Dinner, our <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen did ſeat themſelves all at the Table, amongſt whom was <hi>Du Buiſſon,</hi> having taken ſome Repoſe. They ceaſed not merrily to upbraid one another with their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures. There was only <hi>Audebert</hi> amongſt them, on whom them could not caſt the leaſt aſperſion; for although he was of a lively and frolick diſpoſition, yet he was very temperate and wiſe, and delighted more to conferre with the Learned Men of that City, than to ſeek after the Company, and Acquaintance of the Courteſans. <hi>Francion,</hi> having conſidered of the Fortune of all the reſt, did experimentally proteſt, that there was not one amongſt them whoſe Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune was ſo great as his own, and that <hi>Valerius</hi> and
<hi>Ergastus</hi> having both conſpired againſt him, it was a queſtion which of them both had done him the greateſt prejudice. Some affirmed it was
<hi>Valerius,</hi> who accuſed him for coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of counterfeited Money, which was a Fact attended with ſo much Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny, that it deſerved Death for its puniſhment. But he himſelf maintained, that it was <hi>Ergaſtus</hi> who did him the greateſt Injury, for he cauſed him to loſe the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59287:173"/>favour of <hi>Nays,</hi> and the prejudice he received was not ſo much, when he had betrayd him to the ſight and knowledge of
<hi>Emilia</hi> (for he received nothing but pleaſure in that Converſation) as when he provoked <hi>Emilia</hi> to complain to <hi>Nays</hi> of him. Noe long after Dinner <hi>Dorini</hi> came unto him, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, that
<hi>Lucio</hi> had ſo great a Care of his affaires, that he had rendred him leſſe diſtaſtfull to his Coſin, and ſhe permitted that he ſhould give her a viſit that afternoon; He immediatly prepared himſelf to wait upon her, and was more curious in his habit than before, having no care to accommodate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a place which was but a priſon to him; He was accompanied with thoſe Gentlemen of <hi>France:</hi> When he came into the room where <hi>Nays</hi> was, ſhe look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him with a more ſerious and majeſtical countenance, but he feared nothing, and did ſpeak unto her in this manner. Madam, behold an Innocent falſely accuſed, who doth addreſſe himſelf unto you, to give you the teſtimonies of his Integrity. She replyed, Be not you ſo vain, as to profeſſe your ſelf to be altogether exempted from offence, for by that means you will take from me the glory to forgive you. Since Pardon is aſſured me on your part (ſaid
<hi>Francion</hi>) I may well eſteem my ſelf to be faulty. Nay, in ſome degree you are ſo, ſaid <hi>Nays,</hi> for it is true that you have loved
<hi>Emilia.</hi> I have loved her (replyed <hi>Francion</hi>) as I love ſome fair fruit upon a Tree, which I only look on, but have no deſire either to touch them, or to taſt of them; or rather, I have loved her with ſuch a love as we bear unto beautifull flowers, and not more paſſionately. I do believe, Madam, you have no deſire to have me blind, or that I ſhould ceaſe to conſider of the workmanſhips of Nature, I doe find them all beautifull, but the affection which I do bear unto them doth return to you; for there is nothing of beauty in the world, but in ſome part it reſembleth you. Howſoever, if it were a ſin, ſo to live, and ſo to love, I ſhould willingly change even that humour, to be found within the compaſſe of any obedience: You may ſpeak what you pleaſe (ſaid <hi>Nays</hi>) but you cannot ſo eaſily excuſe your ſelf for your falſe Loves, as for your falſe moneys. <hi>Dorini</hi> then taking her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, did intreat her to forbear the ſeverity of her Rigour, alleging, that <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> was not ſo much to be blamed as ſhe believed, and if he had given a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to
<hi>Emilia,</hi> it was at that time when ſhe herſelf not looking upon him with a friendly eye, he endeavoured ſome other way to give a reſpite to the afflictions of his mind. For the reſt, ſhe had already ſufficiently underſtood, that there was nothing which did oblige him to that Lady, who was ſuddenly to be marryed to <hi>Ergaſtus.</hi> On the other ſide, ſhe conſidered with her ſelf, that if ſhe ſhould break off with him, having already gone ſo far, ſhe ſhould be laught at by all the world, and that
<hi>Francion</hi> himſelf, having many friends, and power enough, might be inforced by his paſſion to put in practice ſome dangerous Counſels. She was willing therefore to give him a particular entertainment, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the acceptation of his ſervice; ſo that there ſeemed to be betwixt them a new Contract, and a new Accordance. <hi>Dorini</hi> was of advice that the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was no longer to be delayed, becauſe their Enemies, who were jealous of their happineſſe, would be always buſying themſelves to hinder the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of their Loves. They ſent therefore for a Prieſt, and were betroathed on that hour, and their marriage on the next morning was to be ſolemnized. When <hi>Francion</hi> was returned to his lodging with his friends, he told them, that for the time to come he would be more wiſe than heretofore, for he believed, that being eſpouſed to
<hi>Nays,</hi> he now ſhould arrive at a ſafe Port, and ſhould float no more on the Sea of uncertain affections, on which heretofore he troubled his repoſe, being every hour in danger to be ſhipwracked. The diſgrace which he received for <hi>Emilia</hi> did then repreſent it ſelf before his eyes, inſomuch that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e abſolutely reſolved with himſelf to love none but <hi>Nays</hi> only. He alſo indeavoured to perſwade his friends to retire themſelves from a diſſolute life, and to be no longer an evil Example un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:59287:173"/>The Evening paſſed away in theſe conſiderations, and on the next morning every one made himſelf gallant to aſſiſt at the marriage of <hi>Francion</hi> and <hi>Nays.</hi> They were glad to underſtand, that on that day alſo <hi>Ergaſtus</hi> was eſpouſed to <hi>Emilia,</hi> who although he eſteemed her to be moſt beautifull, and full of merit, yet he had within him a ſecret repugnance to marry her, when he remembred that <hi>Francion</hi> had frequented her Company. He propounded to himſelf, that it may be he had been too familiar with her, and it was not his leaſt grief, that he himſelf was a procurer of it. This remorſe of Conſcience was ſufficient to puniſh him, but more gentle it was, or at leaſt not ſo publick, as was the puniſhment of
<hi>Valerius,</hi> who being condemned, for having coyned falſe moneys, was ſent on the ſame day into baniſhment; <hi>Corſegua</hi> alſo, and he who accuſed <hi>Francion,</hi> having aſſiſted <hi>Valerius</hi> in his bad practices, were both condemned to the Galleys. For <hi>Bergamin</hi> and
<hi>Salviati,</hi> who would have circumvented <hi>Francion</hi> in another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they had not committed ſo great a Crime, they were therefore left without any other puniſhment but their own miſery. The others who ſo rigorouſly were ſentenced, had committed other exorbitances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their laſt impoſture. There was alſo hanged on that day a Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purſe, who at the Gibbet ſpeaking in his own defence, did affirm, that he was none of thoſe who did ſteall money from others, but on the contrary, that two days before he had put a great deal of money into the Pocket of a Frenchman. He was asked more at large concerning this particular, and it was known, that it was the ſame man whom <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſegua</hi> had hired to make ſo cunning a conveyance, that his falſe moneys might be found in the Pocket of
<hi>Francion;</hi> ſo that his innocence was now fully juſtified to the contentment of all thoſe who knew him, and more particularly of thoſe who were at the marriage, to whom all the news was related. There was at the marriage no great Company, only the moſt intimate of the friends, and the neareſt kinred of <hi>Nays;</hi> for it is not the cuſtome there to make any great Aſſembly, or that the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment ſhould be extraordinarily magnificent at the marriage of a Widdow. The principal joy was, of the parties newly marryed. It ſhall ſuffice that they contented themſelves in the enjoyment of their legitimate pleaſures, and that none may ſeem to participate in their Contentment, we will not be elaborate to expreſſe it. It is enough to affirm that it was extreme, and that it hath never ſince been diminiſhed. <hi>Francion</hi> finding himſelf obliged to live no more at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, did take upon him from that day, ſo ſerious, and ſo grave a temper, that you might almoſt ſay, he was not the ſame Man; Nevertheleſſe it is ſuppoſed, that although he underſtood well enough that it is not permitted to doe evil, that good may come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, yet he did with ſome difficulty repent of thoſe many petty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies which in his youth he had committed to chaſtiſe the vices of men. As for
<hi>Raymond</hi> and <hi>Du Buiſſon,</hi> Whatſoever Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances he could make unto them, they would imploy the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the time they had to ſtay in <hi>Rome,</hi> in ſollacing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the pleaſures of the world, <hi>Audebert</hi> came firſt of them all into <hi>France,</hi> who did put himſelf into the train of the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ambaſſador, being at that time on his return; for having ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied himſelf in ſeeing all the rarities of <hi>Italy,</hi> he had no deſire to reſide there any longer. He took not <hi>Hortenſius</hi> with him, for <hi>Nays</hi> had placed him with a Cardinal, who was one of her Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, where he lived at his own pleaſure, and loſt not his hopes of being a King, for the happy condition in which he was did mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly <pb n="41" facs="tcp:59287:174"/>elevate his courage, inſomuch that from day to day, he atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded when the <hi>Polonians</hi> ſhould ſend another Ambaſſador to him, and by this means his converſation became always moſt delightfull. When <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> perceived that at laſt <hi>Raymond</hi> and <hi>Du Buiſſon</hi> were preparing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>France,</hi> he was willing to accompany them, and with his new Spouſe to take a journey with them into his own Country, to viſit his friends and kinred. <hi>Dorini</hi> was one of their number, and their Iourney was moſt happy and pleaſant. <hi>Francion</hi> was exceſſively glad to ſee himſelf for a few moneths amongſt his antient acquaintance, and at that time it was, when he did relate unto diverſe of them his unparalleld Adventures.</p>
